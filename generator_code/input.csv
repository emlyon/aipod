Wu Guangmei,Xu Gong de Koster Zou,16/03/2019,anglais,Optimal Design and Planning for Compact Automated Parking Systems,"Compact automated parking (CAP) systems are fully automated parking systems, which store cars densely. Such systems are mainly used in congested cities all over the world, providing rapid parking access and safe vehicle storage. We study a prominent new technology, with relatively low cost and rapid response. The system has a rotating ring equipped with shuttles in each tier for horizontal transport, and uses two lifts in the middle of the CAP system for vertical transport. We present a dedicated lift operating policy under which it uses one lift for storage and another for retrieval, and a general operating policy under which it uses both lifts for storage and retrieval. We propose queuing networks for single-tier and multi-tier systems based on two different policies for operating the lifts (a dedicated and general operating policy). We validate the analytical models using simulation based on a real application. We also conduct a sensitivity analysis in which we vary speeds of lifts and car rotation. Then we use the analytical models to optimize the system layout by minimizing the retrieval time. Furthermore, combining time efficiency and system cost, we find an appropriate system layout for designers. Third, we compare two lifts under dedicated and general operating policies. Forth, we find the optimal number of the lifts through a general compact automated parking system. Finally, we calculate the investment cost of a CAP system under different system configurations and compare it with an alternative design: a cubic parking system."
Bai Qingguo,Gong Jin Xu,01/02/2019,anglais,Effects of carbon emission reduction on supply chain coordination with vendor-managed deteriorating product inventory,"While many supply chains use vendor-managed inventory (VMI) to handle deteriorating products, they employ special facilities (e.g., cold warehouses), which produce significant carbon emissions. This new operational practice motivates us to investigate the effects of carbon emission reduction on a supply chain with one manufacturer and two competing retailers for deteriorating products under VMI, which has not been fully studied in the existing literature. Carbon cap-and-trade regulation and investment in green technologies are used to curb carbon emissions generated by production and inventory holding in this system. To bench mark the performance of the decentralized system, an optimization model for the centralized system is formulated to show that there exists an upper bound on the profit penalty for decentralization and the carbon emissions of the centralized system may be lower than those of the decentralized system. A revenue-sharing contract is then proposed to improve the profit and emissions of the decentralized system. The results show that the supply chain can be coordinated perfectly when the demand depends on the manufacturer's green technology level and two competing retailers' selling prices. Numerical examples with sensitivity analysis are further provided to test the robustness of the supply chain's operational decisions."
Bertoni Fabio,Marti Reverte,01/02/2019,anglais,The impact of government-supported participative loans on the growth of entrepreneurial ventures,"We study the employment and sales growth of entrepreneurial ventures that have received a government-sponsored participative loan (PL), a hybrid form of financing between debt and equity. We use propensity-score matching (PSM) and instrumental variable analysis (2SLS) to study a sample of 512 entrepreneurial ventures that received a PL from a Spanish government agency between 2005 and 2011. We find evidence that PLs significantly boosted their beneficiaries’ employment and sales. In the two years following loan issuance, a 1-million-Euro PL generated an increase in average employment of between 12.1 (PSM) and 14.7 (2SLS) units and an increase in sales of between 1.09 and 1.97 million Euro relative to the average for the two years prior to loan issuance. The effect is larger for high-tech, young and small entrepreneurial ventures and for those that received a PL during the global financial crisis. The effect on growth is significant and stable, and PLs increase their beneficiaries’ annual growth by 10.6% for employment and by 18.0% for sales. We do not find evidence of industry or regional spillovers, nor do we find differences in the probability of survival of PL beneficiaries after we control for their characteristics."
Houy Nicolas,Le Grand,14/01/2019,anglais,Optimizing immune cell therapies with artificial intelligence,"Purpose: We determine an optimal injection pattern for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and for the combination of anti-VEGF and unlicensed dendritic cells. Methods: We rely on the mathematical model of Soto-Ortiz and Finley (2016) for the interactions between the tumor growth, angiogenesis and immune system reactions. Our optimization algorithm belongs to the class of Monte-Carlo tree search algorithms. The objective consists in finding the minimal total drug doses for which an injection pattern yields tumor eradication. Results: Our results are twofold. First, optimized injection protocols enable to significantly reduce the total drug dose for tumor elimination. For instance, for an early diagnosis date, a total dose equal to 58% of the standard anti-VEGF dose enables to eliminate the tumor. In the case of drug combination, associating 25% of the total standard anti-VEGF dose to 10% of the dendritic cell total standard dose eradicates tumor. Our second result is that administering a dose equal to the maximal standard dose allows for later diagnosis date compared to standard protocol. For instance, in the case of anti-VEGF injection, the optimal protocol postpones the maximal diagnosis date by more than one month. Conclusions. Overall, our optimization based on artificial intelligence delivers significant gains in total drug administration or in the length of the therapeutic window. Our method is flexible and could be adapted to other drug combinations."
Guida Tony,Coqueret,01/01/2019,anglais,Ensemble Learning Applied to Quant Equity,"This chapter proposes to benefit from the advantages of machine learning (ML) in general and boosted trees in particular, e.g. non‐linearity, regularization and good generalization results, scaling up well with lots of data. It gives a mildly technical introduction to boosted trees. The chapter introduces the construction of the dataset with the feature and labels engineering, and the calibration of the ML applying rigorous protocol established by the computer science community. It describes the data used and the empirical protocol for the ML model. The chapter also introduces the concept of confusion matrix and all the related metrics in order to precisely assess a ML model's quality. It provides guidance on how to tune, train and test an ML‐based model using traditional financial characteristics such as valuation and profitability metrics, but also price momentum, risk estimates, volume and liquidity characteristic."
Le Grand François,,01/01/2019,anglais,Perron–Frobenius theory recovers more than you might think,"In their seminal article, Hansen and Scheinkman (2009) proved that Perron–Frobenius theory helps to recover a probability measure that can be used to price long-term claims. In this paper, we show that the recovered probability also contains information about market structure. More precisely, we provide an example in which Perron–Frobenius theory can be used to measure the degree of limited market participation."
Lindvert Marta,Patel Smith,01/01/2019,anglais,Microfinance traps and relational exchange norms,"In interdependent social groups, microfinance traps occur when conflicts arise between borrowers’ affective ties related to family needs and instrumental ties related to obligations toward their loan group. Thus, the social capital that facilitates microfinancing can lead to conflicting obligations toward business needs and economic obligations toward family. Building on an inductive field study among female entrepreneurs in Tanzania, we conceptualize microfinance traps. By using relational contract theory to interpret the qualitative data, we argue that microfinance traps can be reduced by balancing role integrity, preserving norms and reciprocity, and harmonizing the social matrix toward the family and loan group."
Klofsten Magnus,Fayolle Guerrero Mian Urbano Wright,24/12/2018,anglais,The entrepreneurial university as driver for economic growth and social change,"Limitations of the research on the various leadership and strategic issues facing universities seeking to become more entrepreneurial has led this special issue to focus on the management, development, and implementation of this vision. We have solicited original research on the strategic challenges that these universities currently encounter. Researchers in management and related disciplines have contributed to this field of inquiry, which is having growing implications for our universities and stakeholders in the social and economic spheres. We begin by tracing an overarching framework, to which we add brief descriptions of the contributing papers in this special issue. To conclude, we outline future research goals and discuss how, around the world, academic actors involved in university development - such as university managers and policy makers - could view the ideas presented here."
Foliard Stéphane,Le Pontois Fayolle Diermann,10/12/2018,anglais,The Legitimacy of Teachers in Entrepreneurship Education,"Entrepreneurship teachers (ETs) evolve in an environment where different categories of people interact: students, teachers and stakeholders. Assuming one or more identities or roles, teachers, practitioners, ex-entrepreneurs and/ or researchers are the ‘transmitters’1 of entrepreneurship education (EE). The question of recognition of teachers’ professional status is not always addressed (Hargreaves, 2000). Scientific research in EE shows certain weaknesses (Byrne, Fayolle, & Toutain, 2014; Fayolle, 2013), notably, a lack of interest in questions of (i) the perceived legitimacy of ETs and (ii) the support they receive in carrying out their work (particularly professional development). Taking a decidedly multidisciplinary perspective, this chapter aims to deal with the question of the perceived legitimacy of ETs using a literature review that covers all disciplines having shown an interest in the notion of teacher legitimacy. The legitimacy of EE depends on the interactions between legitimate instructors and legitimate students in a given context, which respects certain collectively accepted norms. It also depends on the context and the objective of EE. Following the example of a university hospital worker (doctor), ETs can be practitioners, teachers and researchers. Their degree of expertise, position in the institution, positioning in relation to other actors – students, peers, colleagues, institutional and professional stakeholders – and the discourse they use are the elements that constitute their legitimacy."
Aliaga-Isla Rocío,Huybrechts,01/12/2018,anglais,From “Push Out” to “Pull In” Together,"Definitions are important! They are composed of words that express what people think. Despite numerous efforts to bring about a clear and unbiased definition of social entrepreneurship, there is still confusion as how social entrepreneurship should be defined. The objective of this paper is not to state a novel definition, this means not to push out"", but rather to ""pull in"" together to better understand what the scholars are talking about through their own social entrepreneurship (SE) definitions. In doing so, we contribute to the literature by synthesizing and analysing the SE definitions to better understand the field. To do so, a combination of methods was used: systematic review to reach the articles proposing definitions and memetic analysis to understand the content of the definitions by analysing their memes. From the analysis, three main categories were considered: entity types, entrepreneurial opportunities and intentions/promises. Future research lines and implications are highlighted."""
Allali Jérémy,Le Courtois Majri,01/12/2018,anglais,Credit risk and solvency capital requirements,"Credit risk permeates the assets of most insurance companies. This article develops a framework for computing credit capital requirements under the constant position paradigm and taking into account recovery rates. Although this framework was originally derived under the Solvency 2 regulation, it also provides concepts that can be useful under other international regulations. After a brief survey of the existing technology on rating transitions and default probabilities, the paper provides new results on risk premium adjustment factors. Then, three different procedures for reconstructing constant position market-consistent histories of credit portfolios from quoted Merrill Lynch indices are given. The reconstructed historical credit values are modeled via mixed empirical-Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) dynamics and a detailed parameter estimation is performed. Several validations of the estimation are also provided. Finally, credit Solvency Capital Requirements are computed and an analysis of the results per rating class is given."
Arregle Jean-Luc,Miller Hitt Beamish,01/12/2018,anglais,The role of MNEs’ internationalization patterns in their regional integration of FDI locations,"Multinational enterprises (MNEs) use the regional aggregation and integration of their foreign direct investments as an important part of their internationalization. Internationalization decisions are integrated at the region level; however, little work has focused on explaining the extent of this regional integration. We develop theoretical arguments and test new hypotheses about MNEs’ general international experience and international geographic scope (i.e., institutional diversity and international dispersion) as predictors of their extent of regional integration. The results from a sample of Japanese MNEs validate these different effects, suggesting these MNE level variables are important for regional influences on their internationalization decisions. The results further our understanding of how MNEs organize their internationalization and strategic geographic foci."
Fattoum Asma,Delmar Wright,01/12/2018,anglais,The best of both worlds,"Research Summary: To prevent loss of control post‐IPO, founder‐CEOs can implement control‐enhancing mechanisms disconnecting ownership from voting rights. However, this decision places them in a rich versus king dilemma. If they choose to implement such mechanisms and secure the king position, they risk losing money at IPO. If they choose not to implement control‐enhancing mechanisms and adopt the rich position they risk losing control over the firm. We investigate theoretically and empirically the outcomes of this dilemma in a multi‐period setting (at IPO and post‐IPO). We found that the majority of founder‐CEOs who choose the king option recover initial wealth loss, and hence, they can reconcile the rich and king paths in the long‐run post‐IPO."
Nekhili Mehdi,Chakroun Chtioui,01/12/2018,anglais,Women’s Leadership and Firm Performance,"We evaluate the relationship between the appointment of women to CEO or Chair positions and firm performance, and shed light on the differences between family and nonfamily firms. By using a propensity score matching approach on a sample of 394 French firms over the period 2001–2010, we find major discordances between women’s leadership style and family business expectations relative to firm performance, as measured by return on assets and Tobin’s q. Notably, our results support the conjecture that family firms, which are more conducive to transformational leadership, offer women a more appropriate climate for exercising the function of Chair than that of CEO. In contrast, women CEOs perform better in nonfamily firms. Our findings move away from the predominant focus on barriers and stereotypes images about the female leadership and support the contingency theory of leadership, which states that the effectiveness of a leadership style depends on the organization and culture in which leaders operate, and on task-related positions."
Carney Michael,Estrin Van Essen Shapiro,29/11/2018,anglais,Business Groups reconsidered,"In this paper, we consider the potential paths of Business Group's (BGs) evolution. We organize our analysis around the two dominant perspectives on BGs: institutional voids (IV) and entrenchment/exploitation (EE). We suggest that the empirical evidence does not entirely support either perspective, and neither fully predicts what we sometimes observe; namely that BGs not only persist and thrive, but also sometimes do so as internationally competitive firms. This indicates that a more contextualized approach is required, and we propose a conceptual framework that can guide future thinking. In so doing, we take explicit account of two key factors relevant to the dynamics of BG evolution: the state's capacity to create market-supporting institutions and the ability of business groups to adapt to evolving institutions. Our framework accommodates the possibility of multiple outcomes, including ones consistent with the IV and EE perspectives, but also ones consistent with the internationalization of BGs, including those from emerging markets."
Chen Qian,Lu Gong Tang,22/11/2018,anglais,Why do users resist service organization’s brand mobile apps?,"Service organizations increasingly develop brand apps (mobile applications) to expand service channels to the mobile end. Attracting their customers to install the brand app is critical. But there is widespread resistance to brand apps. This resistance can be classified as postponement, opposition and rejection. This study explores consumers’ active resistance of brand app in service organization. We examine the effects of adoption barriers and knowledge of alternatives quality on the three resistance behaviors and moderating effects of satisfaction with off-line service. The results show three resistance behaviors are affected by different reasons, and cross-channel synergy exists. Our study extends the theoretical understanding of the antecedents of and cross-channel influences on resistance to brand apps, with practical implications that managers should adopt different strategies for postponers, opponents and rejecters."
Trejos Cristian,van Deemen Rodriguez Gomez,07/11/2018,anglais,Overconfidence and disposition effect in the stock market,"Modern financial theory relies on the rationality assumption of investors even though, evidence suggests that market investors are affected by behavioural biases such as overconfidence and disposition effect. Overconfident investors perceive situations better than what they actually are, while investors exhibiting disposition effect tend to dispose winner shares and keep loser ones. However there is not clear causal relationship between both biases. We contribute to the literature about overconfidence and its relationship with the disposition effect, using a simulation model often named micro world, representing an artificial financial stock market. We propose a methodology combining qualitative (QCA) and quantitative (Logistic Regression) techniques to correlate transactions’ outcomes with investors’ characteristics. Results suggest that overconfidence is explained by gender, career and education level, while age, nationality, and profits are not significant variables. We also confirm that investors exhibiting disposition effect are more prone to be overconfident."
Airoldi Massimo,,01/11/2018,anglais,Ethnography and the digital fields of social media,"Qualitative researchers struggle to study the transient fields of social network sites like Twitter through conventional ethnographic approaches. This paper suggests that, in order to step further, we should distinguish between the relatively stable ‘contextual’ fields of bounded online communities and the fluid, ‘meta-fields’ resulting from the aggregation of scattered communicative contents based on their metadata. Both these two intertwined layers of the digital environment interplay with users’ online social practices – which are embedded within offline everyday life and vice versa. While Internet ethnography largely dealt with contextual digital fields, recent developments in the realm of online research allow the ethnographic exploration of digital meta-fields and their publics. This shift recalls Marcus’ appeal for a multi-sited ethnography but, in fact, goes further beyond, towards a truly ‘un-sited’ ethnography. I highlight and discuss the main methodological implications of meta- and contextual fieldworks by presenting an exploratory study of European exchange students’ Facebook identities."
Bozionelos Georgios,Bozionelos,01/11/2018,anglais,Trait emotional intelligence and social capital,"The relationship of trait emotional intelligence (EI) with workplace social capital was investigated in 172 individuals in middle and middle-upper organizational ranks. Social capital was operationalized as: mentoring provision for protégés, expressive networking ties, and instrumental network ties. Two out of the three identified relationships were quadratic. In particular, the relationship of mentoring provision and expressive network ties with EI were of U-shaped nature with overall positive linear trends, while that of instrumental network ties with EI was purely linear and positive. The findings suggest that though in most cases the strongest social capital is possessed by those with high scores on trait EI, low EI may also often offer advantages. Extant knowledge about trait EI is utilized to provide an account for the findings, while there is brief discussion of their implications for theory and future research."
Glau Kathrin,Linders Min Scherer Schneider Zagst,01/11/2018,anglais,"Innovations in Insurance, Risk- and Asset Management","This book covers recent developments in the interdisciplinary fields of actuarial science, quantitative finance, risk- and asset management. The authors are leading experts from academia and practice who participated in Innovations in Insurance, Risk- and Asset Management, an international conference held at the Technical University of Munich in 2017. The topics covered include the mathematics of extreme risks, systemic risk, model uncertainty, interest rate and hybrid models, alternative investments, dynamic investment strategies, quantitative risk management, asset liability management, liability driven investments, and behavioral finance. This timely selection of topics is highly relevant for the financial industry and addresses current issues both from an academic as well as from a practitioner's point of view."
Gong Zhanxue,Li Liu Gong,01/11/2018,anglais,Machine learning in explaining nonprofit organizations’ participation,"The construction of smart cities requires the participation of nonprofit organizations, but there are still some problems in the analysis of driving factors of participation. Based on this, using the structural equation model as the research method, a public satisfaction relationship model, based on the machine learning, for nonprofit organizations participating in the construction planning of smart cities was constructed in this study. At the same time, corresponding assumptions are set, and data are collected through questionnaires. Afterward, the Likert tenth scale was used to score questionnaire questions, and deep learning was conducted in conjunction with the model. The research shows that the model established in this study has good analytical results and has certain practical effects. It can provide suggestions for optimization and can provide theoretical references for subsequent research."
Guida Tony,Coqueret,01/11/2018,anglais,Machine Learning in Systematic Equity Allocation,"Recent criticisms suggest that Machine Learning‐based approaches only suite predicting very short‐term price movements. Tony Guida and Guillaume Coqueret apply well‐known ML algorithms to systematic equity investment, presenting a methodology which shows a critical stage of feature and label engineering, a stet that helps uncover hidden structures in the equity market space. Only then, the authors argue, can a modern quantitative approach make accurate long‐term predictions."
Marti Ignasi,,01/11/2018,anglais,"Transformational Business Models, Grand Challenges, and Social Impact","The starting premise of this paper is that business models can transform social reality—sometimes to an extreme. Then, building on the concept of “grand challenges,” we argue that such transformations can be either positive or negative in nature (or both)—even in the case of business models designed to improve value not only economically but environmentally and socially as well. To further our understanding of the negative aspects, we introduced two conceptual categories of business model: those for oppression or depletion and exclusionary ones. We further argue that bringing the notion of grand challenges center-stage highlights four elements that can contribute to emerging research and inform practice on transformational business models. These elements are: participatory forms of architecture; multivocal inscriptions; scaffolding; and proximity (understood as a caring concern for the “other”). They are central components of what we name transformational business models."
Nekhili Mehdi,Javed Chtioui,01/11/2018,anglais,Gender‐diverse audit partners and audit fee premium,"This study empirically investigates the impact of auditor gender on audit fees in a unique audit regulatory environment, namely France, where joint audit is mandatory by law. Apart from the fact that male and female auditor engagement partners have distinctive behaviors and style, the question also arises at to whether coordination problems between two competing audit firms are exacerbated or mitigated by the presence of a female auditor in the joint auditor pair composition. This issue could be more challenging in the context of International Financial Reporting Standards adoption, which increases audit task complexity, audit risk, and audit effort required for an audit engagement. Using a matched sample of firms from the CAC All‐Shares Index listed on Euronext Paris from 2002 to 2010, we find that, when a female auditor is paired with a male auditor, the difference in audit fees stems not only from the presence of the female auditor partner but also from male–female interaction within the joint auditor pair composition. In a supplementary analysis, we show that the impact on audit fees of both the presence of a female partner and male–female auditor interaction is dependent, but in a different way, on the number of Big 4 audit firms in the auditor pair composition."
Scheurenbrand Klara,Parsons Cappellini Patterson,01/11/2018,anglais,Cycling into Headwinds,"Using the example of cycling we contribute to public policy debates surrounding sustainability. We employ practice theory to shift the debate away from consumer choice and agency to examine instead why sustainable practices are not always available to consumers. Therefore, rather than asking the question “why don't people cycle?” we ask “why is the practice of cycling not thriving?” Practice theory focuses on material, meanings and competences as making up a practice positing that it can only thrive and grow once these elements come together. By looking at how practices compete between each other for the same set of elements we can examine how some practices (i.e. driving, schooling, policing) come to dominate or inhibit others (cycling). In terms of the theme of this special issue then instead of excavating anti-consumption as a pre-cursor to practices (i.e. a choice not to engage in), by opening out practices we examine the mechanisms through which this choice is restricted."
Tavin Bertrand,,01/11/2018,anglais,Measuring exposure to dependence risk with random Bernstein copula scenarios,"This paper considers the problem of measuring the exposure to dependence risk carried by a portfolio with an arbitrary number of two-asset derivative contracts. We develop a worst-case risk measure com- puted over a set of dependence scenarios within a divergence restricted region. The set of dependence scenarios corresponds to Bernstein copulas obtained by simulating random doubly stochastic matrices. We then devise a method to compute hedging positions when a limited number of hedging instruments are available for trading. In an empirical study, we show how the proposed method can be used to re- veal an exposure to dependence risk where usual sensitivity methods fail to reveal it. We also illustrate the ability of the proposed method to generate parsimonious hedging strategies in order to reduce the exposure to dependence risk of a given portfolio."
Zhu Li,Gong Xu Gu,01/11/2018,anglais,Emergency Relief Routing Models for Injured Victims Considering Equity and Priority.,"In humanitarian aid, emergency relief routing optimization needs to consider equity and priority issues. Different from the general path selection optimization, this paper builds two models differentiated by considerations on the identical and diverse injured degrees, where the relative deprivation cost is proposed as one of the decision-making objectives to emphasize equity, and the in-transit tolerable suffering duration is employed as a type of time window constraint to highlight rescue priority. After proving the NP-hardness of our models, we design a meta-heuristic algorithm based on the ant colony optimization to accelerate the convergence speed, which is more efficient than the commonly-used genetic algorithm. Taking 2017 Houston Flood as a case, we find results by performing the experimental comparison and sensitivity analysis. First, our models have advantages in the fairness of human sufferings mitigation. Second, the role of the in-transit tolerable suffering time window cannot be ignored in humanitarian relief solutions. Various measures are encouraged to extend this type of time window for achieving better emergency relief. Finally, our proposed hybrid transportation strategy aiming at diverse injured degrees stably outperforms the separated strategy, both in operational cost control and psychological sufferings alleviation, especially when relief supplies are limited."
Sauerwald Steve,Heugens Turturea Van Essen,19/10/2018,anglais,Are all private benefits of control ineffective?,"Private benefits of control (PBC) are benefits that controlling shareholders consume, but that are not shared with minority shareholders. Research focusing on the value protection role of corporate governance typically frames PBC as principal‐principal (PP) agency costs, and interprets them as a form of minority shareholder expropriation that decreases firm performance. Taking a value creation perspective of corporate governance, however, we propose a more nuanced role for PBC. Specifically, we see them also as principal‐principal (PP) agency benefits that compensate controlling shareholders for their monitoring and advisory services, which can increase firm performance. Since both PP costs and benefits affect firm performance, we theorize that PBC enhance firm performance at a diminishing rate. Furthermore, we show that the effect of PBC on firm performance is more positive when country‐level external governance mechanisms are strong."
Rokka Joonas,Sitz,10/10/2018,anglais,Why teach ethnography to managers (in the big data era)?,"In management circles and beyond, companies are rushing to integrate, adapt and exploit big data in their organisations. Moreover, they are willing to recruit nearly anyone with a mention of “big data” or “artificial intelligence” in their resumes. There are nonstop consultant talks and crowded workshops on big data, and academic journals are rushing out special issues with the magical keywords. Nearly absent before 2011, big data is well on its way to be the most talked about topic in the management press, including the Economist, Financial Times, Wall Street Journal and Forbes."
Younes Dima,Courpasson Jacob,10/10/2018,anglais,Ethics from Below,"Secrecy and ethics are often seen as opposing forces within organizations. Secret work is viewed as unethical, as it excludes others from knowing and is associated with self-interested behavior. We contend that this view does not account for the dynamic inherent to secrecy and to the fact that ethics is embedded in social relations. This paper suggests an alternative view. We consider secrecy as a social process which allows employees to maintain their ethics when faced with managerial policies that affect the quality of their work. Building on an in-depth case study of a team of journalists who worked in secret after their managers decided to prioritize the interests of shareholders and advertising firms, we show how these journalists managed to maintain collective ethics through secrecy and to do their work according to their own moral principles. This paper offers two primary contributions. First, we show a mutually beneficial relationship between ethics and secrecy in organizations, wherein secrecy helps maintaining ethics in everyday work. Second, the paper shows how secrecy can lead to ethical resistance, via a transformation of the power relationship with managers."
Assimakopoulos Dimitris,Papagiannidis,01/10/2018,anglais,Identifying industrial clusters with a novel big-data methodology,"In this paper we propose using a novel big-data-mining methodology and the Internet as a new source of useful meta-data for industry classification. The proposed methodology can be utilised as a decision support system for identifying industrial clusters in almost real time in a specific geographic region, contributing to strategic co-operation and policy development for operations and supply chain management across organisational boundaries through big data analytics. Our theoretical discussion on discerning industrial activity of firms in geographical regions starts by highlighting the limitations of the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. This discussion is followed by the proposed methodology, which has three main steps revolving around web-based data collection, pre-processing and analysis, and reporting of clusters. We discuss each step in detail, presenting the experimental approaches tested. We apply our methodology to a regional case, in the North East of England, in order to demonstrate how such a big data decision support system/analytics can work in practice. Implications for theory, policy and practice are discussed, as well as potential avenues for further research."
Corgnet Brice,Deck DeSantis Porter,01/10/2018,anglais,Information (non)aggregation in markets with costly signal acquisition,"Markets are often viewed as a tool for aggregating disparate private knowledge, a stance supported by past laboratory experiments. However, traders' acquisition cost of information has typically been ignored. Results from a laboratory experiment involving six treatments varying the cost of acquiring signals of an asset's value suggest that when information is costly, markets do not succeed in aggregating it. At an individual level, having information improves trading performance, but not enough to offset the cost of obtaining the information. Although males earn more through trading than females, this differential is offset by the greater propensity of males to buy information such that total profit is similar for males and females. Looking at individual skills, we find that higher theory of mind is associated with greater trading profit, greater overall profit, and an increased likelihood of acquiring information while cognitive reflection is associated with greater profit but not a greater propensity to acquire information."
Forgues Bernard,,01/10/2018,anglais,Kant in pyjamas,"Reflecting on the twenty years that have elapsed since the launch of M@n@gement, I highlight some changes in the world of organizations, the world of organizational research, and the world of academic publications. I argue that, although notable changes have occurred in all three domains, how we do and assess research can still follow long-established canons. In particular, I suggest with Bourdieu that it all rests on reading statistics on pyjamas while thinking of Kant."
Huising Ruthanne,Silbey,01/10/2018,anglais,From Nudge to Culture and Back Again,"The range of organizational responses to regulatory requirements is often explained by observing the organization as a monolithic actor interacting with external agents. We look inside regulated organizations, recognizing them as a web of transactions and norms, to examine how formal and informal organizational practices transform regulatory requirements into normalized activity. This article identifies four levers used at the coalface—or frontline—of the organization to achieve/encourage compliance in organizations: nudge (individual), bureaucracy (roles, rules, and procedures), relational governance (network), and organizational culture (assumptions, values, and artifacts). We map the range of research on coalface governance while displaying the assumptions and implications of each lever often embedded in recommendations to policy makers or organizational managers. We offer this continuum of techniques to invite a richer conversation about ways of pursuing compliance in organizations."
Jalonen Kari,Schildt Vaara,01/10/2018,anglais,Strategic concepts as micro‐level tools in strategic sensemaking,"Research Summary: The purpose of this article is to illuminate the role of concepts in strategic sensemaking. Based on a longitudinal real‐time study of a city organization, we demonstrate how the concept of “self‐responsibility” played a crucial role in strategic sensemaking. We develop a theoretical model that elucidates how strategic concepts are used in meaning‐making, and how such concepts may be mobilized for the legitimation of strategic change. Our main contribution is to offer strategic concepts as a missing micro‐level component of the language‐based view of strategic processes and practices. By so doing, our analysis also adds to studies on strategic ambiguity and advances research on vocabularies."

It proposes an agenda for future research on the role of TBIs as bridging mechanisms and drivers of entrepreneurship and regional development."
Langevin Pascal,Findling Perray-Redslob,01/10/2018,anglais,CWWC's Alternative Fuels Division,"CWWC is a world leader in the production of cement. Because cement production is energy intensive and raises health and sustainability issues, CWWC has increased the use of alternative fuels (e.g., waste) to heat the kilns in place of more traditional fuels (e.g., fuel oil, coal). So far, waste-related activities were integrated in CWWC's cement factories. However, CWWC now considers creating a separate business unit dedicated to waste transformation into usable fuels. The objectives of the case is to have students understand and discuss the challenges of creating interdependent profit centres, implying the implementation of transfer prices. The discussion can remain at a general level or be based on detailed calculations of transfer prices."
M’Chirgui Zouhaïer,Lamine Mian Fayolle,01/10/2018,anglais,University technology commercialization through new venture projects,"This article assesses the performance of a technology business incubator program, established by the French government to support innovative new science and technology-based firms (NSTBF) that seek to commercialize laboratory research results. With a resource-based view and an institutional approach, this study predicts why some incubators may be more successful than others in supporting the development of NSTBF. An original longitudinal data set represents the results of a public incubator program, funded following the passage of a 1999 French law on innovation and research. The findings refer to a sample of 25 operationally active incubators and their 1200 graduated new ventures. This study contributes to the literature on business incubation by showing the importance of various incubator resource inputs for aiding NSTBF projects. It thus provides useful and timely feedback for researchers and policy makers."
Tavin Bertrand,Schneider,01/10/2018,anglais,From the Samuelson volatility effect to a Samuelson correlation effect,"Our first aim in this paper is to introduce a futures-based model able of capturing the main features displayed by Crude Oil futures and options contracts, such as the Samuelson volatility effect and the volatility smile. We calculate the joint characteristic function of two futures contracts in the model in analytic form and use it to price calendar spread options. In an empirical application we show that the model, in contrast to simpler nested models, can be successfully calibrated to market prices of vanilla and calendar spread options. Our second aim is to use this model to analyze the dependence structure of Crude Oil futures contracts. To this end, we propose analytical expressions giving the copula and copula density directly in terms of the joint characteristic function. These tools allow us to perform an in-depth analysis for pairs of futures, and we observe a phenomenon we call the Samuelson correlation effect."
Vijay Devi,Monin,01/10/2018,anglais,Poisedness for social innovation,"When and where do social innovations emerge? We address this question using comparative and historical analyses of organizing for palliative care in India. Although palliative care made in-roads into different parts of India in the 1980s, it evolved as a vibrant sector only in the state of Kerala, through a novel community-based approach. By examining historical and social conditions, we reveal how poisedness, and particularly political poisedness, of time and place manifests in the genesis and propagation of a social innovation. We contribute to the literature on macro-foundations of social innovations by illustrating how an array of organizations and individuals create the very conditions of poisedness that are thereafter leveraged by institutional actors for the construction of novelty and propagation. Moreover, we specify the conditions of poisedness that are conducive to propagation, thereby contributing to conversations on distinct phases of emergence."

As managers often lack sufficient financial resources, these operations are executed with the help of financial backers known as private equity (PE) firms. The transaction is typically financed with a mixture of equity and debt, the latter being a larger proportion of the total deal value than the former."
Kornberger Martin,Leixnering Meyer,03/09/2018,anglais,The logic of tact,"The mass migration of refugees in the fall of 2015 in Europe posed an immense humanitarian and logistical challenge: exhausted from their week-long journeys, refugees arrived in Vienna in need of care, shelter, food, medical aid, and onward transport. The refugee crisis was managed by an emerging polycentric and intersectoral collective of organizations. In this paper, we investigate how leaders of these organizations made decisions in concert with each other and hence sustained the capacity to act as collective. We ask: what was the logic of decision-making that orchestrated collective action during the crisis? In answering this question, we make the following contribution: departing from March’s logics of consequences and appropriateness as well as Weick’s work on sensemaking during crisis, we introduce an alternative logic that informed decision-making in our study: the logic of tact. With this concept (a) we offer a better understanding of how managers may make decisions under the condition of bounded rationality and the simultaneous transgression of their institutional identity in situations of crisis; and (b) we show that in decision-making under extreme pressure cognition is neither ahead of action, nor is action ahead of cognition; rather, tact explicates the rapid switching between cognition and action, orchestrating decision-making through their interplay."
Cléret Baptiste,Dehling Leroy Rokka Sohier Herbert,01/09/2018,anglais,The videographic approach in marketing research,"This article proposes a protocol for the videographic method in marketing research. Its aim is to develop the toolbox available to researchers by outlining how academic videography can be used and by identifying the challenges and opportunities inherent in such an approach. Providing researchers with a concrete guide in this way is also a response to the calls for more widespread use of this method in the academic community. The article presents both the application and an evaluation of the videographic method through four successive phases: pre-production, production, post-production and dissemination. This protocol is based on an analysis of the origins of videographic research – primarily North American. This is complemented by an analysis of the corpus of French-language productions presented at national and international conferences, with the aim of providing a broad and non-ethnocentric vision so as to specify the methodological process and the various choices involved, thereby contributing to the development of creative and innovative studies."
Guitart Ivan,Gonzalez Stremersch,01/09/2018,anglais,Advertising non-premium products as if they were premium,"Non-premium brands occasionally emulate their premium counterparts by using ads that emphasize premium characteristics such as superior performance and exclusivity. We define this practice as “advertising up” and develop hypotheses about its short- and long-term impact on advertising elasticity and brand equity respectively. We test the hypotheses in two large-scale empirical studies using a comprehensive dataset from the automotive industry that includes, among others, the content of 2317 television ads broadcast over a period of 45 months. The results indicate that advertising up increases (decreases) short-term advertising elasticity for non-premium products with a low (high) market share. The results also show that an intensive use of advertising up over time leads to long-term improvements (reductions) in brand equity for expensive (cheap) non-premium products. Furthermore, an inconsistent use of advertising up leads to reductions in brand equity. The results imply that managers of non-premium products with a low market share can use advertising up to increase advertising effectiveness in the short run. However, advertising up will only generate long-term improvements in brand equity for expensive non-premium products. Finally, to avoid long-term reductions in brand equity, advertising up should be consistently used over time."
Gutsatz Michel,Heine,01/09/2018,anglais,Is luxury expensive?,"Although pricing strategies have significant effects on brand performance and have been growth drivers of the luxury industry for decades, there is only little research on luxury pricing strategies. Most academics and managers believe that there is a ‘democratization of luxury’ since the 1980s. Today, luxury is regarded as accessible for almost anyone. On the other hand, researchers and consumers still consider ‘high prices’ as one of the most important luxury characteristics. To resolve this paradox, this paper analyzes ‘expensiveness’ as a key feature of luxury products: Is luxury expensive or has it really democratized? It outlines the different types of luxury with reference to their ‘expensiveness.’ Based on a literature analysis about research on pricing in luxury marketing, the paper presents eight indicators of ‘expensiveness.’ After discussing how the Veblen, Snob and Bandwagon effects break the law of demand, analyses of real data follow with some case studies about the price development of luxury products in different countries and product categories. They show that the method of price comparison by Fourastié can provide brand managers a more realistic picture about the ‘expensiveness’ of their products for their target customers. The paper concludes with some major lessons learned."
Heine Klaus,Atwal Crener-Ricard Phan,01/09/2018,anglais,Personality-driven luxury brand management,"This paper combines the brand personality and brand anthropomorphization concepts and introduces the notion of personality-driven brand management especially for the context of luxury branding. A central part of this paper is a study about the major dimensions of luxury brand personality. Results suggest that there exist five distinct luxury personality dimensions including tradition, modesty, elitism, eccentricity and sensuality. They help brand managers to develop distinct brand personalities by encouraging them to decide between contrasting traits. After presenting the major strategies to bring a luxury brand personality alive, the paper discusses the benefits of personality-based brand management and concludes with some major lessons learned."
Levallois Clément,,01/09/2018,anglais,"The Development of Sociobiology in relation to Animal Behavior Studies, 1946-1975","This paper aims at bridging a gap between the history of American animal behavior studies and the history of sociobiology. In the post-war period, ecology, comparative psychology and ethology were all investigating animal societies, using different approaches ranging from fieldwork to laboratory studies. We argue that this disunity in “practices of place” (Kohler, Robert E. Landscapes & Labscapes: Exploring the Lab-Field Border in Biology. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2002) explains the attempts of dialogue between those three fields and early calls for unity through “sociobiology” by J. Paul Scott. In turn, tensions between the naturalist tradition and the rising reductionist approach in biology provide an original background for a history of Edward Wilson’s own version of sociobiology, much beyond the William Hamilton’s papers (Journal of Theoretical Biology 7: 1–16, 17–52, 1964) usually considered as its key antecedent. Naturalists were in a defensive position in the geography of the fields studying animal behavior, and in reaction were a driving force behind the various projects of synthesis called “sociobiology”."
Liu Jiawen,Gong Zhu Zhang,01/09/2018,anglais,A DEA-based approach for competitive environment analysis in global operations strategies,"While competitive environment analysis is critical to a global retailing operations strategy, there exist research gaps from perspectives of operational performance, retailing industrial environment, and nondiscretionary factors. Therefore, our research objective is to propose a new approach to conduct competitive environment analysis for a global operations strategy in retailing, by examining relationships between discretionary inputs of the supply chain, nondiscretionary inputs of the environment, and performance of retailing. We develop a nondiscretionary data envelopment analysis model to assess performance in retailing and integrate it with econometric analysis. Using multisource data of 124 organizations in the global retailing industry, it is interesting to find: while nondiscretionary factors significantly influence the operational performance of global retailers, firms in an environment with a higher market concentration, larger consumer spending per capita, and smaller inhabitants’ population are more likely to achieve a higher operational efficiency in retailing. Another interesting finding with practical implication is: inputs relevant to outside environment (e.g., suppliers in upstream and outlets in downstream supply chain) can influence operational efficiency more than inputs in internal supply chain (e.g., warehouses)."
Mutlu Canan C.,Van Essen Peng Saleh Duran,01/09/2018,anglais,Corporate Governance in China,"How has the impact of ‘good corporate governance' principles on firm performance changed over time in China? Amassing a database of 84 studies, 684 effect sizes, and 547,622 firm observations, we explore this important question by conducting a meta-analysis on the corporate governance literature in China. The weight of evidence demonstrates that two major ‘good corporate governance' principles advocating board independence and managerial incentives are indeed associated with better firm performance. However, we cannot find strong support for the criticisms against CEO duality. In addition, we go beyond a static perspective (such as certain governance mechanisms are effective or ineffective) by investigating the temporal hypotheses. We reveal that over time, with the improvement in the quality of market institutions and development of financial markets, the monitoring mechanisms of the board and state ownership become more strongly related to firm performance, whereas the incentive mechanisms lose their significance. Overall, our findings advance a dynamic institution-based view by substantiating the case that institutional transitions matter for the relationship between governance mechanisms and firm performance in the second largest economy in the world."
Rokka Joonas,Hietanen,01/09/2018,anglais,On positioning videography as a tool for theorizing,"The purpose of this article is to critically examine videography in the repertoire of visual approaches and delineate a positioning that would be distinctive, inspiring and daring. Notably, we advocate for alternative video-based approaches that expand the field beyond the dominant ‘representational mode’ by embracing the evocative power of video, and it is only in this way that videographic research could emerge into a self-standing research method without falling under other representational orders of analysis such as being read ‘like text’ or frozen into photographic ‘stills’. In so doing, we develop an image of thought of consumer videographies, where the affective forces of video are harnessed towards ‘theorizing’ in an emergent rather than descriptive form."
Ferreira João J. M.,Fayolle Ratten Raposo,31/08/2018,anglais,Entrepreneurial Universities,"With an increasing focus on the knowledge and service economies, it is important to understand the role that entrepreneurial universities play through collaboration in policy and, in turn, the impact they have on policy. The authors evaluate how universities engage with communities while also balancing stakeholder considerations, and explore how universities should be managed in the future to integrate into global society effectively. The book reflects the internationalization of entrepreneurial universities with examples from Australia, Brazil, France, Italy, Malaysia, India, Poland, Portugal, Spain and the UK. Each chapter identifies the differing cultural influences and how changes in policy approaches mean that universities are constantly evolving. The authors also look into how culture influences entrepreneurship education and, in turn, how culture affects the initiatives of policy makers. With a focus on enhancing entrepreneurial opportunities, universities are shown to respond by creating effective initiatives that benefit the wider community through successful collaboration with institutions. The book identifies the close working relationship between new government policies and developing entrepreneurial universities. Researchers, policy analysts and students of entrepreneurship education, education management and policy will find this book a useful supplementary read for understanding the future role of universities."

In this article, we study how visual attention affects the impact that media multitasking has on brand recognition. We theorize that media multitasking will have a different impact on brand recognition depending on whether consumers pay attention to the ad. We tested our hypothesis by creating a laboratory experiment that simulates consumers’ internet browsing experience. We exposed participants to two conditions – executing one task (no multitasking condition) and executing two simultaneous tasks (multitasking condition) – and identified when participants paid attention to the banner ad using an eye-tracking device. In line with our theory, our results indicate that multitasking decreases brand memory but only when participants do not pay attention to the banner ad. The implications of this finding for researchers and advertisers are discussed."

van Wijk Jakomijn,Zietsma Dorado de Bakker Marti,03/08/2018,anglais,Social Innovation,"Social innovations are urgently needed as we confront complex social problems. As these social problems feature substantial interdependencies among multiple systems and actors, developing and implementing innovative solutions involve the re-negotiating of settled institutions or the building of new ones. In this introductory article, we introduce a stylized three-cycle model highlighting the institutional nature of social innovation efforts. The model conceptualizes social innovation processes as the product of agentic, relational, and situated dynamics in three interrelated cycles that operate at the micro, meso, and macro levels of analysis. The five papers included in this special issue address one or more of these cycles. We draw on these papers and the model to stimulate and offer guidance to future conversations on social innovations from an institutional theory perspective."

This paper is based on a 2-year project carried out by a network of academics and practitioners interested in new work practices in the collaborative economy, focusing particularly on collaborative workspaces. We concentrate on the relationships between collaboration and these new work practices according to three levels, individual, community and societal, highlighting their spatial and temporal dimensions. Our results indicate that: boundaries between waged employment and entrepreneurship are not rigid; individuals not only suffer from stress in traditional organisations but also of boredom; new collaborative practices imply rethinking their own competences and prospects, often leading to fundamental life changes; co-working communities can provide collective meaning, crucial to supporting these transformations; they can be orientated towards practice, professional identity, and emotional support to address loneliness and sense-making; public discourses about entrepreneurship and innovation and territorial policies are not clearly linked to innovative practices in collaborative spaces. We conclude that there is need for better coordination between public actors and collaborative communities which should be seen at the heart of economic, educational, industrial and cultural policies targeting the city, aiming at collaborating and sharing."
Deng Ziliang,Yan Van Essen,01/08/2018,anglais,Heterogeneity of political connections and outward foreign direct investment,"By examining the heterogeneity of political connections (PCs), this study reconceptualises the relationship between PCs and outward foreign direct investment (OFDI). Drawing upon resource dependence theory, we hypothesise that firms with ascribed PCs benefit from top political privileges in their home market and have a low OFDI commitment. Firms without any PCs have a medium OFDI commitment because they have to avoid the discriminative competition associated with their inferior political status. Firms with acquired PCs possess relatively strong political and market resources and face exchange pressure; thus, they exhibit a high OFDI commitment. The aforementioned hypotheses are supported by empirical results from probit and Tobit models based on panel data of 482 listed Chinese firms with OFDI from 2003 to 2014."
Huybrechts Benjamin,Haugh,01/08/2018,anglais,The Roles of Networks in Institutionalizing New Hybrid Organizational Forms,"Hybrid organizational forms combine values and practices from different institutional domains, rendering them difficult to fit neatly into the structures of extant organizational forms. Since the work required to institutionalize a new hybrid organizational form may be beyond the resources and capabilities of individual organizations acting alone, we shift the focus to inter-organizational collective action. Using empirical data from a study of a European network of renewable energy cooperatives, we find that, in order to institutionalize the new hybrid organizational form, the network can contribute to overcome the legitimacy challenges inherent in organizational hybridity. In particular, the network builds field-level receptivity to institutional pluralism, collectively codifies the hybrid organizational form, and consolidates legitimation towards plural field-level audiences. In order to perform these institutionalization roles, the network itself becomes increasingly formalized and mobilizes mediating functions involving different types of resources, legitimacy and target audiences. The research advances knowledge of hybrid organizational forms and their collective institutionalization through inter-organizational networks."

Silberzahn Chittima,Arregle,19/07/2018,anglais,The career-horizon problem in capital investments for lone-founder and long-tenure acquirer CEOs in their final career stage,"In this study, we apply organizational identification theory to enrich our knowledge of the career-horizon problem when CEOs are approaching retirement. The extant literature suggests that the closer a CEO is to retirement, the more likely she or he is to avoid long-term firm investments. Focusing on capital investments, we argue that the distinctive organizational identification with the firm of lone-founder CEOs and long-tenure acquirer CEOs can moderate the likelihood that the closer a CEO is to retirement, the more likely she or he is to avoid capital investments. We test and validate our hypotheses on a sample of CEOs in S&P 1500 non-financial firms between 1999 and 2010. This article contributes to the literature on CEO career horizons by providing a new and more fine-grained perspective on the important question of how different types of CEOs consider capital investments and the future of their firms as they approach retirement."
Guillén Ramo Laura,Jacquart Hogg,09/07/2018,anglais,Leadership and the dark triad,"Be build on the concept of self-related uncertainty to explain why individuals with antisocial personalities may be more likely to attain leadership positions in the upper echelons of organizations. In three experiments (Ns = 141, 238 and 602), we showed that individuals who score high on the dark triad of personality (i.e. psychopathy, narcissism and Machiavellianism) react to the distress associated with self-related uncertainty through enhanced hostility against others, which in turn increases their motivation to lead. Our results provide evidence of the significant role played by self-uncertainty in explaining why and when dark triad individuals are able to attain leadership positions. We discuss implications for theory and research on the dark triad, leadership, and identity, and their relevance for understanding both organizational and public leadership."
Clarke Jean,Cornelissen Healey,03/07/2018,anglais,Actions Speak Louder than Words,"A key challenge for entrepreneurs is to convince investors of their business ideas in a pitch. Although scholars have started to explore how entrepreneurs convey their passion and preparedness in a pitch, they have overlooked the possible variation that exists in the verbal and nonverbal expressions of entrepreneurs. We build on research in cognitive science and entrepreneurship to examine the nature and influence of specific forms of speech and gesturing used by entrepreneurs when pitching. In an initial qualitative field study we identify distinct pitching strategies entrepreneurs use, involving different combinations of verbal tactics (using literal and figurative language to frame a venture) and gesture (using different types of hand gestures to emphasize parts of their pitch and convey product and venture ideas). In an experimental study with samples of investors and students, we examine the impact of these strategies on the propensity to invest. We found that although variation in the type of language entrepreneurs used had limited effects, using gestures to depict and symbolize business ideas had strong positive effects. Our findings indicate that the skilled use of gestures by entrepreneurs helps potential investors imagine aspects of a new venture for themselves, enhancing perception of its investment potential."
Birhanu Addis Gedefaw,Geiler Zhao,01/07/2018,anglais,Why Acquisition Experience Matters,"Is director acquisition experience remunerated and how does it benefit the firm? We build on behavioral learning theory and argue that acquisition experience and expertise built up over a director’s career are remunerated at the board level. Moreover, we argue that acquisition experience of both executive and non-executive directors will result in better target identification and bidding behavior at the firm level. When analyzing pay practices of the largest UK companies over nearly two decades, our results indicate that a one standard deviation increase in executive and non-executive directors’ acquisition experience is associated with an increase in total compensation of roughly 6% and 9%, respectively. Acquisition experience is presumably better remunerated for non-executives as they have incentives to hinder the executive directors from engaging in wealth-reducing acquisitions. Moreover, our results suggest that experienced directors are more likely to choose generally more profitable targets that are less of a surprise to the market."
Geiler Philipp,Renneboog Zhao,01/07/2018,anglais,Beauty and appearance in corporate director elections,"We study the role of facial appearance in corporate director (re-)elections by means of director photographs published in annual reports. We find that shareholders use inferences from facial appearance in corporate elections, as a better (higher rated) appearance measure of a director reduces voting dissent. These heuristics are based on perceived competence, trustworthiness, likability, and intelligence, but not on physical beauty. The results are valid for director re-elections but not for first appointment elections as in the latter cases, shareholders may not as yet be familiar with a director’s looks. In firms with few institutional shareholders and more retail investors owning small equity stakes, the latter tend to rely more on facial appearance than institutional shareholders, presumably as institutions conduct more research on the director’s background and performance, and consequently rely less on facial appearance. While female directors generally experience lower voting dissent, their facial appearance does not affect their elections results."
Gomez Pierre-Yves,Wirtz,01/07/2018,anglais,Successfully mobilizing for employee board representation,"Purpose The equal representation of employees on codetermined supervisory boards is one of the distinctive features of the German corporate governance system. This study aims to examine the relevance of the frequent assumption according to which this system is rooted in a typically “German culture”. Design/methodology/approach This research applies Davis and Thompson’s (1994) mobilization theory as an interpretive grid to historical sources to reveal the determinants of the institutionalization of equal board representation in post-war Germany. Findings The present contribution reveals that the supposedly “German tradition” of board representation is a myth. The specific regime of codetermined supervisory boards is instead the outcome of the dramatic political and institutional circumstances of the late 1940s, which saw fierce struggles and the mobilization of various actors ranging from politicians and industrialists to trade unionists. Originality/value The German Catholic Church is shown to have played a significant, albeit seldom recognized, role in this search for institutional consensus. It acted as a broad-based “supporting institution”, positively influencing mobilization efforts in favor of board codetermination and ultimately enabling an agreement to be reached."
Ha Jaekyung,Zuckerman Sivan,01/07/2018,anglais,The Inauthenticity in Legitimacy,"Is being the first entrant in a nascent industry an advantage or a disadvantage? Both institutional theory and population ecology suggest that in a nascent industry an increase in the number of firms legitimize all industry members. However, late entrants may suffer penalties because audiences interpret their late entry as a lack of authenticity associated with low customer commitment. In this paper, we theorize and test how the order of entry shapes firms’ competitive outcomes. Using an experimental approach, we disentangle two at times countervailing forces–audiences’ simultaneous preference for authenticity and legitimacy. We distinguish between “core value” and “symbolic features” in products or services, and argue that the penalty for follower firms is likely to arise when the late entrant firms share even the symbolic features of their predecessor. We test our theory with an online experiment using examples of startup companies in the healthcare industry. The results show that a late entrant suffers from lower levels of market selection when it shares both the business model (core value) and the website design (symbolic features) with the first entrant, but this “copycat discount” is significantly alleviated when the late entrant does not share the first mover’s symbolic features. However, while direct measures of legitimacy show a strong effect on market selection, we do not find support that this is impacted by density."
Karthikeyan Soorjith Illickal,Jonsson Wezel,01/07/2018,anglais,Things Fall Apart,"In times of institutional decline, organizations seek to reposition and differentiate their identities. This presents a challenge as such repositioning and differentiation requires systematic, i.e., substantial and sustained, investments on new identity elements under conditions of significant uncertainty brought about by the decline of an institution. The present study investigates how British political parties handled their identity repositioning and differentiation in the face of the decline of an institution of social class politics over the period from 1970 to 2015. Starting from the premise that institutional decline that unfolds over an extended period presents substantively different uncertainties to organizations, our findings show that (a) organizations work with systematic efforts to reposition their identity only in the latter stage of institutional decline, and (b), such organizational efforts, however, are unlikely to yield distinct identities in the absence of an institution to help coordinate organizational actions at the collective level. We draw implications for theories of identity change, institutional theory, and organizational competition."
Montauti Martina,Wezel,01/07/2018,anglais,The veteran's trap:Structural antecedents and performace consequences of focused market identities,"We advance the veteran’s trap as a phenomenon occurring in segmented markets, where audience members praise both commitment and originality. In such markets, a producer who has developed a focused identity through repeated membership claims to a social category faces performance losses not only in reducing her focus - as prior literature has argued - but also in increasing her focus. Avoiding the discounts of diversification does not prevent the producer from being perceived as increasingly worn by audience members, and from experiencing decreasing returns. Our paper explores the structural antecedents and the performance consequences of the veteran's trap, by tracking the discographies of electronic music artists between 1978 and 2013."

In this paper, we examine whether these insights extend to more complex settings of collective action. While perfect substitutability of resources is a fundamental assumption of existing collective action models, many collective causes, particularly those focused on market formation, require resources across distinct actors that are often imperfectly substitutable. We develop a formal model that shows that heterogeneity under conditions of imperfect substitutability actually exacerbates collective action problems. We examine the central mechanisms governing the existence and resolution of collective action dilemmas for complex causes and we identify the conditions under which collective action is more or less challenging. Analyzing the problem in the context of market formation, we explore implications for those settings with heterogeneous social structure. We discuss the implications of our findings for study of collective action dilemmas, mobilization strategies for collective action, and market formation research."
Wudhikarn Ratapol,Chakpitak Neubert,01/07/2018,anglais,A literature review on performance measures of logistics management,"Today, logistics management requires a comprehensive set of performance indicators that measure both tangible assets and intellectual capital (IC) of organisations. Nevertheless, most of the measures used in the past mainly related to the financial aspect, although some specific components of IC, such as process efficiency and effectiveness, have been considered. Logistics literature lacks a comprehensive consideration of the diverse IC measures, and it is unclear which area of IC requires more focus and development. Therefore, to explore and identify an opportunity for improvement, this study reviews the academic literature related to IC measures in logistics management. This literature review considers 111 academic articles published between 1994 and 2016. Following the six dimensions of the IC-Index, all indicators obtained from the literature are classified according to IC elements. The key contribution of this review is that it addresses the following gaps in the literature: the limited adoption of comprehensive IC methods in logistics studies; underdevelopment of specific indicators and measures used; failure to consider all human capital as well as renewal and development elements; and, finally, lack of academic research considering the influences among the different IC elements and logistics and financial performance."
Houy Nicolas,Le Grand,26/06/2018,anglais,Optimal dynamic regimens with artificial intelligence,"We determine an optimal protocol for temozolomide using population variability and dynamic optimization techniques inspired by artificial intelligence. We use a Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) model based on Faivre and coauthors (Faivre, et al., 2013) for the pharmacokinetics of temozolomide, as well as the pharmacodynamics of its efficacy. For toxicity, which is measured by the nadir of the normalized absolute neutrophil count, we formalize the myelosuppression effect of temozolomide with the physiological model of Panetta and coauthors (Panetta, et al., 2003). We apply the model to a population with variability as given in Panetta and coauthors (Panetta, et al., 2003). Our optimization algorithm is a variant in the class of Monte-Carlo tree search algorithms. We do not impose periodicity constraint on our solution. We set the objective of tumor size minimization while not allowing more severe toxicity levels than the standard Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) regimen. The protocol we propose achieves higher efficacy in the sense that –compared to the usual MTD regimen– it divides the tumor size by approximately 7.66 after 336 days –the 95% confidence interval being [7.36–7.97]. The toxicity is similar to MTD. Overall, our protocol, obtained with a very flexible method, gives significant results for the present case of temozolomide and calls for further research mixing operational research or artificial intelligence and clinical research in oncology."
Alperovych Yan,Quas Standaert,21/06/2018,anglais,Direct and indirect government venture capital investments in Europe,"This paper provides evidence of the broad government presence in the European venture capital industry. Two forms of intervention are considered: first, direct stand-alone government venture capital funds and, second, indirect private funds to which governments commit funds as limited partners. The overall government presence seems to be much more important than previously documented, as we find that the government intervenes, on average, in 42.2% of venture capital investments in Europe. We also show that European countries are heterogeneous in their use of these two channels, and we consider possible early explanations for this choice of policy mix. Lastly, we provide some evidence on the consequences of these policies in terms of SME's perceived access to financing."
Michel Sophie,Saucède Pardo Fenneteau,19/06/2018,anglais,Business interaction and institutional work,"A company's ability to change its position (its relationships with others) depends on a shared interpretation among business network actors of what the company wants to do. The purpose of this study is to examine change in the position of actors in a business network setting. We use the institutional work approach to understand positioning in a business network as an institutional arrangement and explore actors' purposive efforts to maintain or disrupt the rules of the game. We use a multiple case-study approach to explore the fruit and vegetable distribution channel. We discuss what happens when the institutional work carried out by retailers to disrupt the position of wholesalers meets the institutional work carried out by wholesalers to maintain their position. The findings show how interacting institutional efforts result in new positions for wholesalers: the “troubleshooter” position and the “quality enhancer” role. Our study contributes to the field of business-to-business marketing in that it sheds light on the co-creation process of the rules of the game that drive business-to-business interactions. With reference to institutional theory, our study draws on the idea that institutional arrangements are unanticipated consequences of interactions between actors."
Houy Nicolas,Le Grand,07/06/2018,anglais,Administration of temozolomide,"Purpose. We compare the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Metronomic Chemotherapy (MC) protocols for temozolomide administration. We develop an innovative methodology for characterizing optimal chemotherapy regimens. Methods. We use a PK/PD model based on Faivre et al. (2013) for the pharmacokinetics of temozolomide, as well as the pharmacodynamics of its efficacy. For toxicity, which is measured by the nadir of the normalized absolute neutrophil count, we formalize the myelosuppression effect of temozolomide with the physiological model of Panetta et al. (2003b). We introduce a multi-criteria tool for comparing protocols along their efficacy and toxicity dimensions. Results. We show that the toxicity of the MC regimen proposed by Faivre et al. (2013) can greatly be reduced without affecting its efficacy, while the standard MTD protocol efficacy cannot be improved without impairing its toxicity. We also show that for any acceptable toxicity level, the optimal protocol remains closely related to standard MTD. Conclusions. Overall, our new method enables a rich comparison between protocols along multiple dimensions. We can rank protocols for temozolomide administration. It is a first step toward building optimal individual protocols."
Beck Nikolaus,Swaminathan Wade Wezel,01/06/2018,anglais,Industry Clusters and Organizational Prototypes,"In this article, we argue that in addition to facilitating organizational learning and specialization, an industry cluster related to tradition or to the practice of a craft influences audience expectations through the definition of the prototypical features that define an organizational form. Analyzing the population of northern Bavarian (Franconian) breweries, we show that compliance with a prototype involves multiple dimensions and depends on an organization’s location in geographic space with reference to the center of the industry cluster. Using qualitative interviews, archival data, and a survey of consumers, we provide evidence that as distance from the cluster center increases, organizations are more likely to deviate from the prototype and suffer fewer of the negative consequences that result from such deviations."
Corgnet Brice,DeSantis Porter,01/06/2018,anglais,What Makes a Good Trader?,"We utilize laboratory experiments to pinpoint three drivers of trader performance: fluid intelligence, cognitive reflection and theory of mind. Fluid intelligence provides traders with computational skills necessary to undertake statistical inference. Cognitive reflection helps traders avoid behavioral biases thereby allowing them to extract signals from market orders and update their prior beliefs accordingly. Theory of mind allows traders to assess the informational content of orders thus offering hints on the quality of those signals. We show cognitive reflection and theory of mind are complementary because traders benefit from understanding signals’ quality only if they are capable of processing them."

We point to the growing importance of different sources of capital for entrepreneurs and emerging research trends pertinent to academics, practitioners, and policymakers. We explain common questions and suggest scope in future work for combining segments."

Laffineur Catherine,Tavakoli Fayolle Amara Carco,01/06/2018,anglais,Insights from Female Entrepreneurs in MENA Countries,"The objective of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive picture of the situation of women entrepreneurs in the MENA region. The study is based on an original survey conducted by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) in six countries—Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine and Tunisia, between 2015 and 2016. The main results of the study are as follows. First, there exists a discriminatory environment for women entrepreneurs in MENA regions. They encounter difficulties in accessing finance, which constitutes their principal obstacle to entrepreneurship. They feel that the existence of stereotypes and preconceptions about the role and abilities of women are important barriers to entrepreneurship. Secondly, their primary need in terms of their activities is entrepreneurial education—they must learn how to manage others successfully and to maximise their entrepreneurial skills. Thirdly, the socio-economic characteristics of women entrepreneurs are important determinants of business growth and dedication. Specifically, we observe that education, networks, and experience in business are important drivers of firms’ size and export potential, whilst governance, structure and marital status are factors influencing the percentage of women employed in women’s businesses. Finally, we note that married women who have their own premises to house their entrepreneurial activities, as well as less educated single women, are more engaged in the pursuit of their entrepreneurial activities."
Le Courtois Olivier,,01/06/2018,anglais,Some Further Results on the Tempered Multistable Approach,"This article provides new results on the tempered multistable approach. After a preliminary section recalling the main definitions, we show the correspondence between a series representation and a characteristic function representation for asymmetrical field-based tempered multistable processes and for asymmetrical independent increments tempered multistable processes. We also show that both processes are semimartingales, which is a convenient property in finance. Next, we study the structure of autocorrelations that is conveyed by this approach. Finally, we provide an illustration showing the term structures of Value-at-Risk that can be obtained with this model."
Rupp Deborah E.,Shao Skarlicki Paddock Kim Nadisic,01/06/2018,anglais,Corporate Social Responsibility and Employee Engagement,"Growing evidence suggests that employees’ perceptions of their employer’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) relates positively to employee work engagement. This is an important connection given the impact of work engagement on both employee health and organizational productivity, as well as the importance of CSR for society. In this paper, however, we argue that the CSR perceptions-work engagement relationship cannot be assumed to be universal, and that both individual and contextual factors will place meaningful boundary conditions on this effect. Integrating motivation and cross-cultural theories, we propose that the relationship between employees’ CSR perceptions and their work engagement will be stronger among employees who perceive higher CSR-specific relative autonomy (i.e., employees’ contextualized motivation for complying with, advocating for, and/or participating in CSR activities); and that this amplification effect will be stronger among employees who are higher on individualism (studied at the individual-level of analysis). These predictions were mostly supported among a sample of 673 working adults from five different regions (Canada, China [mainland], France, Hong Kong, and Singapore), and while controlling for first-party justice perceptions, moral identity, employee demographics, and employer/nation characteristics. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."
Vicdan Handan,Hong,01/06/2018,anglais,Enrollment of space into the network of sustainability,"This ethnographic study, conducted at the Ecovillage at Ithaca, illuminates how spatial design configurations of a community shape the ongoing project of sustainable living. To articulate the ideological transformations of the community, actor-network theory is employed as the theoretical framework that facilitates further understanding of the sociomateriality of space and the roles spatiality plays as an actant in the network of sustainability. Soja’s spatial theory, with a focus on the agencing of space, strengthens this analysis. We demonstrate how spatial design principles create opportunities and challenges for the community members as they pre(pro)scribe privacy issues, responsibilize actors, and segregate the community from the mainstream. Amid this dynamic process for achieving sustainability, we observe and document performativity of space in the actor network."
Xhauflair Virginie,Huybrechts Pichault,01/06/2018,anglais,How Can New Players Establish Themselves in Highly Institutionalized Labour Markets?,"How can new players seeking to serve nonstandard worker categories (such as project-based workers) establish themselves into labour markets that are highly institutionalized? This paper explores the case of SMart, a Belgian community-based labour market intermediary that successfully developed solutions to better represent the interests of project-based workers and secure their discontinuous careers. Using an organizational legitimacy approach, we find that labour market entry and growth involve different types of boundary-crossing when addressing the needs of workers that do not fit into established categories. However, to justify boundary-crossing, the new player must complement its pragmatic work on delivering new services and tools with conceptual (cognitive) and structural (moral) legitimation work."
Zou Bipan,Xu Gong de Koster,01/06/2018,anglais,Evaluating battery charging and swapping strategies in a robotic mobile fulfillment system,"Robotic mobile fulfillment systems (RMFS) have seen many implementations in recent years, due to their high flexibility and low operational cost. Such a system stores goods in movable shelves and uses movable robots to transport the shelves. The robot is battery powered and the battery depletes during operations, which can seriously affect the performance of the system. This study focuses on battery management problem in an RMFS, considering a battery swapping and a battery charging strategy with plug-in or inductive charging. We build a semi-open queueing network (SOQN) to estimate system performance, modeling the battery charging process as a single queue and the battery swapping process as a nested SOQN. We develop a decomposition method to solve the analytical models and validate them through simulation. Our models can be used to optimize battery recovery strategies and compare their cost and throughput time performance. The results show that throughput time performance can be significantly affected by the battery recovery policy, that inductive charging performs best, and that battery swapping outperforms plug-in charging by as large as 4.88%, in terms of retrieval transaction throughput time. However, the annual cost of the RMFS using the battery swapping strategy is generally higher than that of the RMFS using the plug-in charging strategy. In the RMFS that uses the inductive charging strategy, a critical price of a robot can be found, for a lower robot price and a small required retrieval transaction throughput time, inductive charging outperforms both plug-in charging and battery swapping strategies in terms of annual cost. We also find that ignoring the battery recovery will underestimate the number of robots required and the system cost for more than 15%."
Orellano Martha,Lambey-Checchin Medini Neubert,29/05/2018,anglais,Towards an integration of lifecycle thinking into PSS business models,"Industry is facing a deep transformation in production and consumption modes, moving towards sustainable and customer-oriented practices. In this context, Product-Service Systems (PSS) provide innovative business models that can create a higher value compared to traditional product-centric approaches. Fostering the transformation of the manufacturing industry towards PSS requires a holistic approach spanning over business model definition and transformation. During the last two decades, the research about business models has been generally focused on the economic and governance issues of the internal value chain. Only little literature has explained the business model as a dynamic system, which encompasses the value creation throughout the entire lifecycle of the offer. In this paper, we investigate and discuss the contribution of lifecycle thinking to the business model approach for PSS. This paper presents a systematic literature review of peer-reviewed journals and indexed conference papers in order to get a large scope of analysis. 33 papers between 2010 and 2017 were analysed. As a result, we propose a conceptual framework for designing business models for PSS offers with a lifecycle perspective illustrated by an example inspired by a real case company."
Fayolle Alain,Ramoglou Karatas-Ozkan Nicolopoulou,15/05/2018,anglais,Philosophical Reflexivity and Entrepreneurship Research,"Entrepreneurship research attracts scholars from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Yet the field is multi-paradigmatic and lacking consensus, even on the nature of core entrepreneurial phenomena. What is recognized is that it is characterized by dynamic and emergent processes - a complex interplay between actors, processes and contexts. As a result, post-positivistic approaches are gaining traction in a field long dominated by positivistic philosophies. This book reflects on the fundamental philosophical basis of entrepreneurship scholarship. It explores the shifting meanings of entrepreneur and entrepreneurship, the unexamined assumptions which lie behind the established discourses which legitimize or dismiss the possibilities for scholarship. Contributing scholars adopt a reflexive approach to entrepreneurship research challenging readers to question their approaches and assumptions and explicitly defend them against competing alternatives. Building on this critical reflection, this book provides space for philosophical reflexivity in the conduct and publication of scholarly enquiry and will be of great interest to scholars, researchers and advanced students in all aspect of entrepreneurship study."
Soenen Guillaume,Eib Torrès,11/05/2018,anglais,The cost of injustice,"In this paper, we build on the allostatic load model, developed in stress research, to explore the impact of entrepreneurs’ overall justice perceptions on emotional exhaustion and firm performance. Results revealed that the relationship between overall justice and emotional exhaustion was mediated by rumination about work. Further, building on recent work by Baron et al. (Journal of Management, 42(3), 742–768, 2016), which highlighted that company founders have more resources to deal with stress, we hypothesized that the relationship between rumination about work and emotional exhaustion was moderated by whether the entrepreneur was the founder of the venture or not. Results revealed that indeed founders appeared to be immune to the consequences of rumination about work elicited by injustice at work, while non-founders suffered from it. Moreover, emotional exhaustion was related to the monthly firm performance. Implications for research and practice are discussed."
Bertoni Fabio,Lugo,01/05/2018,anglais,Detecting abnormal changes in credit default swap spreads using matching-portfolio models,"We evaluate the size and power of different statistical tests and adjustment methods for matching-portfolio models to detect abnormal changes in credit default swap (CDS) spreads. The sign-test generally dominates the signed-rank test in terms of size, and dominates both the t-test and the signed-rank test in terms of power. Traditional adjustment methods often lead to a misspecified sign-test. We propose a new and parsimonious method (the spread-matched method), which leads to a well-specified and more powerful sign-test. The superiority of the spread-matched method is particularly evident for observations characterized by extreme levels of CDS spread. Analyses of CDS samples differing by contract maturity, data source, and time period confirm these results. We perform an event study on rating downgrades to illustrate how the choice of tests and adjustment methods can affect inference."
Corgnet Brice,Gómez-Miñambres Hernán-González,01/05/2018,anglais,Goal Setting in the Principal-Agent Model,"We study a principal–agent framework in which principals can assign wage-irrelevant goals to agents. We find evidence that, when given the possibility to set wage-irrelevant goals, principals select incentive contracts for which pay is less responsive to agents' performance. Agents' performance is higher in the presence of goal setting despite weaker incentives. We develop a principal–agent model with reference-dependent utility that illustrates how labor contracts combining weak monetary incentives and wage-irrelevant goals can be optimal. The pervasive use of non-monetary incentives in the workplace may help account for previous empirical findings suggesting that firms rely on unexpectedly weak monetary incentives."
Cumming Douglas J.,Groh Johan,01/05/2018,anglais,"Same Rules, Different Enforcement","We present and analyze a novel set of enforcement data from the European Securities Market Authority during the period following the European Union’s harmonized rule setting on securities market abuse. The data show significant differences in the intensity of enforcement across Europe. The empirical tests are highly consistent with the view that the intensity of enforcement is the most statistically robust and economically significant predictor of market abuse detection. In particular, the data identify three important arms of enforcement: the number of supervisors, which enhances detection; formalized cooperation, which facilitates surveillance; and imprisonment, which facilitates deterrence. We discuss research, practitioner implications, and policy implications for securities regulation across several key European countries."
Duran Patricio,Van Essen Heugens Kostova Peng,01/05/2018,anglais,The impact of institutions on the competitive advantage of publicly listed family firms in emerging markets,"Research Summary: We develop an institutional explanation for the finding that the competitive advantage publicly listed family firms (PFFs) enjoy over other publicly listed firms varies across emerging markets. We propose that PFF performance is contingent on the state of four types of institutions—formal constraining, informal constraining, formal enabling, and informal enabling institutions. We test these ideas with a meta‐analysis of 177 primary studies, situated in 49 countries. Our results show that the competitive advantage PFFs enjoy is stronger when formal constraining institutions are less developed and when suitable informal enabling institutions are present. However, their competitive advantage is weaker when formal enabling and informal constraining institutions are less developed. We conclude that the competitive advantage of PFFs in emerging markets is contingent on local institutional conditions. Managerial Summary: We develop a framework to improve our understanding of how institutions impact the competitive advantage of publicly listed family firms (PFFs) in 49 emerging markets. The framework informs the decisions of PFF owners and managers concerning where to compete and when to invest in distinctive characteristics of family involvement, like a long‐term orientation, familial control, stewardship, and reputational capital. While our baseline expectation is that PFFs enjoy a competitive advantage in emerging markets, the model also specifies in which contexts the competitiveness of PFFs will be compromised. Our framework offers guidance to policymakers interested in increasing the economic contribution PFFs make to their jurisdictions, which they can ensure by developing PFF‐favoring institutions that strengthen the competitive advantage of these firms."
Hietanen Joel,Rokka,01/05/2018,anglais,Companion for the videography ‘Monstrous Organizing – The Dubstep Electronic Music Scene’,"This companion essay contributes to video-based organizational research by critically assessing conventional representational modes of videographic practice and conceptualizing an ‘expressive’ ontology for videographic research. We offer an image of thought that foregrounds the creative and powerfully affective potential of both videographic work and spectatorship. To advance this perspective and to inspire future research, we present our videography (length 30 minutes) that integrates various ‘expressive’ elements in montage form. We use the film to scrutinize the potential of video-based research and several methodological considerations tied to it. In doing so, we argue that video-based organizing of research activities can be seen as ‘monstrous’, an entire emergent mode of aesthetic storytelling that comes into being not in ‘capturing’ or ‘recording’, but rather as an affective production of potentialities."

According to YOFC case, the authors show that continuous learning and absorption, proprietary R&D and product innovation, good use of every opportunity and favorable development policy, talent reserve and intelligence support, active transformation by sizing up the situation, independent operation, and elimination of monopolization are the implications of transformation and upgrade of the optical fiber industry."
Bommier Antoine,Le Grand,26/04/2018,anglais,Risk Aversion and Precautionary Savings in Dynamic Settings,"We study the saving behavior of infinitely long-lived agents who face income uncertainty and deterministic interest rates. Using monotone recursive preferences, we prove that risk aversion unambiguously increases savings. The result accounts for possibly binding borrowing constraints and holds for very general specification of income uncertainty, which can follow any kind of stochastically monotone process."
Dattée Brice,Alexy Autio,20/04/2018,anglais,Maneuvering in Poor Visibility,"Innovation ecosystems are increasingly regarded as important vehicles to create and capture value from complex value propositions. While current literature assumes these value propositions can be known ex-ante and an appropriate ecosystem design derived from them, we focus instead on generative technological innovations that enable an unbounded range of potential value propositions, hence offering no clear guidance to firms. To illustrate our arguments, we inductively study two organizations, each attempting to create two novel ecosystems around new technological enablers deep in their industry architecture. We highlight how ecosystem creation in such conditions is a systemic process driven by coupled feedback loops, which organizations must try to control dynamically: firms first make the switch to creating the ecosystem following an external pull to narrow down the range of potential applications; then need to learn to keep up with ecosystem dynamics by roadmapping and preempting, while simultaneously enacting resonance. Dynamic control further entails counteracting the drifting away of the nascent ecosystem from the firm's idea of future value creation and the sliding of its intended control points for value capture. Our findings shed new light on strategy and control in emerging ecosystems, and provide guidance to managers on playing the ecosystem game."

The sound of his footsteps echoed in the night air, beginning to invade his concentration. He had just finished dinner and faced the daunting task of preparing for a meeting with graduate students at the city’s premier business school the next morning. The fine wine and good dining did little to ease his growing concern about the future direction of his new company and the role he should play in its development. Fine Point Films, a company he had recently launched, was in good shape. Its progress at this early stage had even exceeded his own expectations, but herein lay the problem. A major international player had expressed interest in taking a controlling stake in his firm. Now he had to decide whether this was a good opportunity for him and indeed his business, or an inopportune time to walk away. He tightened the scarf around his neck to keep out the chill, but it was no defence against his growing anxiety."
Pomiès Anissa,,13/04/2018,anglais,A flat theorization of niche market emergence,"What is a niche market, and how does it emerge within an existing, large-scale market? To answer these questions, I explore the emergence of the coffee shop niche market in France. Coffee shops are small-size businesses serving acidic coffees prepared by skilled baristas. Some of which participate in a yearly contest organized by a new actor in the industry, a transnational professional association called Specialty Coffee Association. Coffee shops stand out from traditional French cafés offering bitter espressos made by professionals with no training in coffee preparation. Although a new coffee shop is opening almost every month since 2010, the number of coffee shops remains limited: less than 60 coffee shops were coexisting with approximately 35.000 cafés in 2015 (author’s inventory). Building on a three-year ethnographic inquiry into coffee shops, traditional cafés and barista championships, I analyze market exchanges and the frames shaping them. The data set is composed of both visual and discursive data that I analyzed using Actor-Network Theory, a sociological theory that is getting greater attention in the field of consumer research. I find that the emergence of a niche market requires three related phenomena. First, some actors from outside destabilize the existing network of stakeholders, and problematize the frame shaping the mainstream market. Second, the outsiders create a new frame and enroll other market actors into their own network. Third, the new frame circulates, shaping the emerging niche market. These three phenomena nourish themselves, and occur simultaneously. I contribute to market dynamics -a growing body of literature in the field of consumer research- by conceptualizing niche market creation as a mechanism based on the moving of a new frame within a growing network of actors."
Fayolle Alain,Landström Gartner Berglund,10/04/2018,anglais,Institutionalization of Entrepreneurship Research,"The institutionalization of entrepreneurship is undeniably a good thing for the members of the research community, as it implies the legitimization of particular research topics and research practices; the emergence of norms for developing and publishing this research; and the creation of structures that provide employment opportunities and a conducive environment for pursuing research. However, we can also question if this institutionalization is such a good thing when it comes to producing critical, innovative, contextualized, and complex research or when considered from the point of view of non-academic entrepreneurship stakeholders and society in general. The objective of this bookis to challenge the main research streams, theories, methods, epistemologies, assumptions and beliefs dominating the field of entrepreneurship. In order to achieve this objective, this book comprises six conceptual and empirical contributions, each one unorthodox, controversial, inspiring and challenging. This book was originally published as a special issue of Entrepreneurship and Regional Development."

Carberry Edward J.,Engelen Van Essen,01/04/2018,anglais,Which firms get punished for unethical behavior?,"Although there is ample evidence that stock markets react negatively to unethical corporate behavior, our understanding of the mechanisms that shape variation in these reactions across different incidents of misconduct remains underdeveloped. We propose and test a framework for explaining this variation by focusing on the role of the media in disseminating initial information about misconduct. We argue that the signaling effects of this information are important for investors because corporations have strong incentives to limit the information they disclose about misconduct. More specifically, we hypothesize that investors are more likely to react negatively when the media presents clear and credible information that misconduct occurred, that the firm was responsible for it, and that the misconduct was the result of deeper organizational problems. We also predict that information which signals that a firm has restorative capacity tempers investor reactions when the media places blame for misconduct on the corporation rather than specific individuals. We test our hypotheses in a unique sample of 345 acts of corporate misconduct in five European countries. Our findings provide broad support for our hypotheses, and we discuss implications for research on corporate misconduct and the role of non-state actors in regulating unethical corporate behavior."
Gruda Dritjon,McCleskey Berrios,01/04/2018,anglais,Seems Fair to Me,"Drawing on both relational and shared leadership theory and utilizing social consensus, we examine the relationship between percieved leader fairness, leader consensus (LC), and group performance. We do so by conceptualizing LC as a new way of hypothesizing and examining shared leadership. LC derives from mutual dyadic perceptions of all members in a team. First, we examine perceptions of leader fairness as a possible antecedent of LC. Second, we investigate the mediational effect of dyadic perceptions of leadership (i.e., LC predicts group performance). In two multisource studies using a round-robin design, we demonstrate that when team members reach a clear consensus about their team leader, perceived leader fairness was positively associated with LC. Furthermore, teams who perceived their leaders as fair exhibited higher group performance."
Gull Ammar Ali,Nekhili Nagati Chtioui,01/04/2018,anglais,Beyond gender diversity,"We apply the system GMM regression estimation approach to a matched sample of French firms listed on Euronext Paris during the period 2001–2010 in order to investigate the relationship between female directors and earnings management by considering their specific (statutory and demographic) attributes. We first find that the presence of female directors deters managers from managing earnings. However, this finding does not hold when the statutory and demographic attributes of female directors are taken into account, thus showing that the detection and the correction of earnings management require particular competencies and skills. Interestingly, we find that business expertise and audit committee membership are key attributes of female directors that promote the effective monitoring of earnings management. An important implication of our findings is that the decision to appoint women on corporate boards should be based more on their statutory and demographic attributes than on blind implementation of gender quotas. Finally, our supplementary analysis reveals that female CEOs and CFOs are strongly inclined to reduce earnings management."

We anchor this special issue at the heart of an emerging body of research indicating that bricolage is the most appropriate approach to consider social firms operating in an environment characterized by institutional constraints or weak regulatory or political support (Di Domenico, Haugh, and Tracey 2010; Gundry et al. 2011). We describe both social entrepreneurship and bricolage. We then identify what closely links these notions. We conduct a literature review of the articles written on the nascent and growing research area at the intersection of social entrepreneurship and bricolage. We finally provide a brief overview of the contributions of each of the papers of this special issue and conclude by outlining a research agenda for future activities in this area of inquiry."
Le Grand François,Ragot,01/04/2018,anglais,A class of tractable incomplete-market models for studying asset returns and risk exposure,"We present a class of tractable incomplete-market models, where agents face both aggregate risk and limited participation in financial markets. Tractability relies on the assumptions of small asset volumes and of a period utility function that is linear beyond a threshold, in line with Fishburn’s (1977) contribution in decision theory. We prove the existence of an equilibrium and derive theoretical results regarding asset prices and consumption choices. This small-trade model is able to reproduce a low safe return and a high equity premium, together with a realistic representation of household exposure to both idiosyncratic and aggregate risks."

Moreover, mediating effect of other constructs of TPB, i.e., attitude towards entrepreneurship (ATE), subjective norms (SN) and perceived behavioural control (PBC) is also examined in this study. Design/methodology/approach This study involves a variance-based partial least square-structural equation modelling approach for analysing responses from 381 fresh business graduates. Findings Findings of this study revealed that SS positively influences EI and also that this relationship is fully mediated by ATE, SN and PBC. Research limitations/implications Due to limited resources, cross cultural comparison and multi-group analysis were not performed, which are considered as a limitation of this study. Practical implications It is expected that the findings of this study can help policy makers, researchers and academicians in better understanding of critical role of SS for understanding the intentions of nascent entrepreneurs. Social implications Further, findings of this study suggest that academicians and policy makers need to take heed towards relatively less explored phenomenon of SS to enhance the attractiveness of entrepreneurial career in fresh business graduates. Originality/value This study has proposed a model for assessing impact of SS on EI. By doing so, this study extends TPB in the context of EI. Moreover, findings of this study are a unique step forward, and offer a new insight towards better understanding of the determinants of EI in fresh business graduates."

Moreover, our findings also indicate that the effect of job satisfaction on work performance is less salient for family members, but more significant for non-family members. Our results further show that managerial positions moderates the main effects. This paper enriches the literature of family business by examining the importance of family membership and managerial position in the governance of family enterprises in an emerging country."

While previous studies that use lower mid-point input/output (I/O) dwell point policy consider single-command cycles (SC), this paper builds travel-time models of dual-command cycles (DC). The S/R crane also dwells in the lower mid-point of the rack when it is idle. We validate analytical models using simulation and use analytical models to optimise system dimensions. Numerical experiments are used to compare DC with SC. The results show that DC outperform SC in terms of cycle time of one command."
Corgnet Brice,Hernán-González,29/03/2018,anglais,Revisiting the Trade-off Between Risk and Incentives,"Despite its central role in the theory of incentives, empirical evidence of a trade-off between risk and incentives remains scarce. We reexamine this trade-off in a workplace lab environment and find that, in line with theory, principals increase fixed pay while lowering performance pay when the relationship between effort and output is noisier. Unexpectedly, agents produce substantially more in the noisy environment than in the baseline despite weaker incentives. In addition, principals’ earnings are significantly higher in the noisy environment. We show that these findings can be accounted for when agents maximize a non-CARA utility function or when they exhibit loss aversion."

Wallmeroth Johannes,,23/03/2018,anglais,Investor behavior in equity crowdfunding,"Using a hand collected data-set, this paper analyzes the investment behavior of over 15,100 investors and over 42,200 investments on one of Germany’s largest equity crowdfunding portals. It shows that paramount contributions come from one subpopulation. Contributions of EUR 5000 and larger from the first 59 campaigns account for 50.6% of the raised capital while they make up a mere 3.2% of all investments. When these investments are linked to investor profiles, these individuals are found to invest less frequently, suggesting different investment behaviors among crowd-investors. This significantly advances the understanding of equity crowdfunding by showing that the crowd is not a homogenous community. Furthermore, it is found that for investors who make these investment sizes, men are not statistically more likely to be a part of this group. These findings provide numerous revelations for policy-makers, equity crowdfunding platforms, as well as entrepreneurs."
Bennouri Moez,Chtioui Nagati Nekhili,01/03/2018,anglais,Female Board Directorship and Firm Performance,"Using a sample of 394 French firms for the period of 2001 to 2010, we study the relationship between female directorship and firms’ accounting (ROA and ROE) and market-based (Tobin's Q) performance. We find that female directorship significantly increases ROA and ROE, and significantly decreases Tobin's Q. We postulate that these relationships are affected by the attributes of female directors. To this end, we collect a set of nine different attributes of female directors capturing their monitoring capabilities and contribution to the board's human capital (demographic and board relational attributes). We find that the positive relationship between accounting performance and female directorship remains when we include these attributes, while the negative relationship between Tobin's Q and female directorship disappears. Interestingly, the different attributes of female directors do not uniformly affect accounting and market-based performance. We explain the different relationships between attributes and firm performance by the tradeoff between the benefits and costs of diversity on board effectiveness, particularly in a low investor protection environment."
Burgelman Robert A.,Floyd Laamanen Mantere Vaara Whittington,01/03/2018,anglais,Strategy processes and practices,"Research Summary: Building on our review of the strategy process and practice research, we identify three ways to see the relationships between the two research traditions: complementary, critical, and combinatory views. We adopt in this special issue the combinatory view, in which activities and processes are seen as closely intertwined aspects of the same phenomena. It is this view that we argue offers both strategy practice and strategy process scholars some of the greatest opportunities for joint research going forward. We develop a combinatory framework for understanding strategy processes and practices (SAPP) and based on that call for more research on (a) temporality, (b) actors and agency, (c) cognition and emotionality, (d) materiality and tools, (e) structures and systems, and (f) language and meaning."
Caporin Massimiliano,Costola Jannin Maillet,01/03/2018,anglais,“On the (Ab)use of Omega?”,"Several recent finance articles use the Omega measure (Keating and Shadwick, 2002), defined as a ratio of potential gains out of possible losses, for gauging the performance of funds or active strategies, in substitution of the traditional Sharpe ratio, with the arguments that return distributions are not Gaussian and volatility is not always the relevant risk metric. Other authors also use Omega for optimizing (non-linear) portfolios with important downside risk. However, we question in this article the relevance of such approaches. First, we show through a basic illustration that the Omega ratio is inconsistent with the Second-order Stochastic Dominance criterion. Furthermore, we observe that the trade-off between return and risk corresponding to the Omega measure, may be essentially influenced by the mean return. Next, we illustrate in static and dynamic frameworks that Omega-based optimal portfolios can be closely associated with classical optimization paradigms depending on the chosen threshold used in Omega. Finally, we present robustness checks on long-only asset and hedge fund databases, that confirm our results."
Fugate Mel,Soenen,01/03/2018,anglais,Predictors and processes related to employees’ change-related compliance and championing,"This field study of a merger examines the antecedent factors and processes that explain two different forms of employee support for change—compliance and championing. Our overarching goal is to understand why some employees comply and others champion change efforts. We examine the combined effects of context and person factors on both positive and negative employee reactions to change, and then investigate the differential effects of these reactions on employee support for change. Results support our hypotheses and show that change management support (context factor) negatively predicts threat appraisals and positively predicts challenge appraisals. Both compliance and championing are positively predicted by challenge appraisals, and threat appraisals are negatively related to championing. Analyses also reveal that the positive relationship between change management support and challenge appraisal is stronger when dispositional resistance to change (person factor) is high. Moderated-mediation analyses suggest employees’ compliance and championing for change are differentially affected by management actions, their own dispositional resistance, and that these effects are mediated through positive and negative appraisals."
Guedri Zied,Fattoum Delmar,01/03/2018,anglais,Multiple Blockholder Structures and Family Firm Performance,"This study examines how multiple blockholder structures affect family firm performance. Building on arguments from both principal–principal agency and familiness perspectives, we suggest that asymmetrical distribution of voting power among family and nonfamily blockholders hurts firm performance. Further, we suggest that the larger the number of blockholder types, the stronger the negative effect of voting-power asymmetry among family and nonfamily blockholders on firm performance. We provide empirical support for our hypotheses using a longitudinal sample of 413 French family firms over the 1992–2012 period."
Liu Tian,Gong de Koster,01/03/2018,anglais,Travel time models for split-platform automated storage and retrieval systems,"In traditional automated storage and retrieval (AS/R) systems, the storage and retrieval machine travels simultaneously in the horizontal and vertical directions. The so-called split-platform AS/R (or SP-AS/R) system consists of platforms (or shuttles and lifts) that can move independently in horizontal (shuttles) and vertical (lifts) directions. This paper studies two dual command travel time models for such systems. We formulate a continuous travel time model for an SP-AS/R system with a dedicated lift per rack and another travel time model for an SP-AS/R system with a dedicated lift per job type. Then we analyse the performance of these two models. The two models are validated by computer simulation and give quite accurate results. We show that the optimal cycle time gap with the upper bound derived by an existing literature can be as large as 26%. We find interesting management insights for system implementation: when the shape factor of the rack is approximately less than 1, the policy using a dedicated lift per rack is better; when the shape factor of the rack is approximately more than 1, the policy using a dedicated lift per job type outperforms."
Yousafzai Shumaila,Fayolle Lindgreen,28/02/2018,anglais,Women Entrepreneurs and the Myth of ‘Underperformance’,"Taking a fresh look at how performance is defined by examining the institutional power structures and policies, eminent scholars herein explore ways to overcome constrained performance and encourage women’s entrepreneurial activities through a variety of methodological approaches and geographical contexts. Significantly, this book adds a critical perspective to defining ‘success’ and ‘performance’, shattering misconceptions of underperformance in women-owned enterprises. The contributing authors raise questions on the limiting concept of the ‘entrepreneur’ and have valuable insights into policies to facilitate female entrepreneurs. Instead of taking a one-sided and narrow approach with regards to understanding the entrepreneurship performance phenomenon, this book argues that future researchers should take a fresh look at business performance, considering structural constraints, definitions of success and other socio-political factors. Scholars in the fields of entrepreneurship, gender studies, and institutional theory, as well as those who have a general interest in critical research, will benefit from this progressive step in entrepreneurship research."
Legrand Céline,Al Ariss Bozionelos,27/02/2018,anglais,Migrant CEOs,"This study discusses the main barriers that qualified migrants face in their route towards becoming chief executive officers (CEOs) along with the strategies they employ in their quest to reach the top. The study was conducted in France, a leading economic power with a long history of migration. A relational analytic framework was adopted, where in-depth interviews with migrant CEOs were triangulated with accounts from native CEOs, organizational leaders, and institutional actors. It emerged that meso- and macro-level factors created powerful barriers to advancement, while migrant CEOs tended to deploy four career strategies, two of them reactive – adaptation/adjustment and overcompensation – and the other two proactive – differentiation and manoeuvring. In addition, substantial differences were identified in the accounts of migrant CEOs and the other participants as to the existence of barriers and awareness of these by organizational actors."
Liu Jiawen,Zhang Gong,23/02/2018,anglais,An integrated data analysis of configurations of supply chain integration,"While some research contends that supply chain integration improves operations competency, other argues that the impact of supply chain integration on operations competency is less significant or not so clear. Based on empirical testing typologies and uncovering taxonomies, this paper examined the linkages among customer–supplier integration, supply chain process integration, cost competency, and flexibility competency empirically in strategic fit research and advances a new conceptual perspective to investigate supply chain integration. Using a sample of 124 organizations in the retailing industry, this paper found three configurations of supply chain integration with strategic fit to operational competencies for superior business performance. Case studies based on 56 organizations in three configurations were conducted to provide additional insights for strategic fit and we utilized multiple discriminant analysis to assess the validity of three configurations. We provide a new framework for theoretical advances in the supply chain integration field and help practitioners make decisions for strategic-fit supply chains across multiple departments."

Quas Anita,D'Adda,17/02/2018,anglais,High-tech entrepreneurial ventures seeking external equity,"In this paper, we study the demand of high-tech entrepreneurial ventures for external equity, revealing the conditions that determine whether, when and where they decide to seek external equity during their lives. We also provide evidence on the most important reasons for not looking for external equity at all. We focus on a sample of 530 high-tech entrepreneurial ventures located in 7 European countries and founded between 1984 and 2009. We reveal that company-level characteristics, namely the human capital, the innovativeness, the size, the asset intangibility, and the alternatives to equity capital (internal cash flows and debt) determine whether, when (i.e., at what age) and when (i.e., in international or domestic markets) companies seek external equity. Industry- and country-level variables also play a secondary role in explaining high-tech entrepreneurial ventures’ demand for external equity."
Chiambaretto Paul,Wassmer,14/02/2018,anglais,Resource utilization as an internal driver of alliance portfolio evolution,"This article aims to understand the role played by resource utilization levels as a driver of alliance portfolio evolution over time. Based on our theoretical framework and on a case study of Qatar Airways (199.3–2010), we develop insights into the micro-dynamics of resource structuring in firms that possess an alliance portfolio. Our research shows that firms can create either their own or network resources with different deployment modes according to their resource utilization levels to remain profitable. We also emphasize that optimized resource utilization is a key driver of resource-structuring efforts in firms. Finally, we show that based on the focal firm's life cycle phase, the level of resource utilization changes and leads to various resource-structuring mechanisms that can be observed at the alliance portfolio level."
Tixier Joseph,Loi La Pontois Tavakoli Fayolle,08/02/2018,anglais,Entrepreneurship education effectiveness,"In literature there is agreement about the need of improving studies’ robustness with respect to the methods used to assess entrepreneurship education (Gielnik, Frese et al., 2015). Some authors have also stressed the concept that more complex phenomena should be investigated by looking, for example, at those variables that act as moderators in the relationship between education and outcomes (Fayolle and Gailly, 2015); and that new outcomes ought to be explored apart from personal attitudes and intentions (Nabi et al., 2016). We extend these suggestions by claiming that researchers should also reflect on the theoretical lenses that could drive the formulation of future hypotheses on entrepreneurship education evaluation. Current works, in fact, rarely make reference to evaluation models to guide an assessment study. By drawing from the field of education and organizational psychology, in this chapter we present some theoretical points that we consider as crucial also for assessing entrepreneurship education programs. These theoretical reflections are aimed at nurturing a constructive debate in the field."
Delanoë-Gueguen Servane,Fayolle,01/02/2018,anglais,Crossing the Entrepreneurial Rubicon,"The dynamics leading from intention to start-up remain poorly understood. Drawing on the mindset theory of action phases, our empirical study identifies a motivational and a volitional phase in the pre-start-up stage. Only during the motivational phase does entrepreneurial intention help identify future starters. Once individuals have crossed the so-called entrepreneurial Rubicon, it no longer matters. We also show that, through this process, the support needs expressed by individuals evolve to become implementation-driven. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply the mindset theory of action phases to nascent entrepreneurship. We discuss key implications for researchers and practitioners."
Marti José,Quas,01/02/2018,anglais,A beacon in the night,"Policymakers around the world have created several schemes to support financially constrained SMEs. However, whether these mechanisms improve the access to external sources of finance or on the contrary crowd out private players remains a relevant question. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of a recent form of government support, called participative loan, in improving recipient SMEs’ access to external financial debt. Relying on the literature about the certification effect, we develop hypotheses on the conditions under which the improvement is stronger. The empirical analysis is based on a sample of 488 Spanish SMEs that received participative loans from a Spanish government agency and a control group of 719 matched twins. We show that the former register a significantly higher external financial debt (+31.5%). The effect is stronger for smaller firms, or for those operating in high-technology sectors, which suffer more acutely from information asymmetries, and negligible for firms that already received a support from another government-supported institution. After ruling out alternative explanations, we interpret this result as a positive evidence of government certification of SMEs towards banks."
Timajchi Ali,Mirzapour Al-E-Hashem Rekik,31/01/2018,anglais,Inventory routing problem for hazardous and deteriorating items in the presence of accident risk with transshipment option,"In this study, we address an Inventory Routing Problem for hazardous and deteriorating pharmaceutical items in a healthcare network. Each hospital's demand is assumed to be deterministic but time varying over a finite planning horizon. Demand can be satisfied through a supply network, either from the main central pharmacy, or from other related hospitals' drugstores by allowing the transshipment option. The medicines deteriorate under a constant rate during the storage period. The proposed model is a bi-objective mixed integer mathematical programming. The first objective aims to minimize the total cost of logistics including ordering, transportation, delivery, pickup, shortage and inventory holding costs. The second objective function attempts to minimize the maximum accident loss during distribution among all periods. To consider the accident loss, for each route, two essential parameters are estimated based on historical data; the occurrence probability and severity index of accident. The model therefore attempts to utilize the best configuration of the routes and transshipment option to satisfy the demand while minimizing the costs and accident loss simultaneously. Several numerical examples are generated and solved by CPLEX and compared with the solutions of an efficient Hybrid Genetic Algorithm (HGA). The results show that the transshipment option not only can be used as a lever to increase the economic supply network performance through saving the routes, but also it can help the system to avoid risky routes."

Since its creation, the Alucam plant has systematically applied policies that simultaneously integrate economic, social and environmental aspects. The originality of our contribution is that we describe a case where the three elements that make up corporate social responsibility (economic, social and environmental) are intertwined. Although this combination of elements had not formally materialised at the time, the case examined shows early awareness – comparatively ahead of its time and relatively well combined between the 1950s and the 1980s – of the three dimensions of corporate social responsibility."
Heslin Peter Andrew,Keating Minbashian,25/01/2018,anglais,How Situational Cues and Mindset Dynamics Shape Personality Effects on Career Outcomes,"The substantial literature on dispositional antecedents of career success (e.g., extraversion and conscientiousness) implies that being low in career-facilitating traits may hamper people’s careers. We develop a cognitive-affective personality system theory about the role of situational cues, personality, and mindsets regarding the plasticity of one’s attributes in determining when this will occur and how the related dysfunctional dynamics may be mitigated. We draw on trait activation theory to describe how the interaction of situational cues, personality, and mindsets may trigger an array of cognitive-affective units within a cognitive-affective personality system that influence subjective and objective career outcomes. The contributions of this article are to offer the largely between-person careers literature a within-person account of when and why people experience subjective and objective career success as a function of their personalities, situational cues, prevailing mindsets, and career contexts. A theoretical account of how personality predicts subjective career outcomes more strongly than objective career outcomes is thereby provided. Our intent is to also extend trait activation theory by considering the cognitive and affective dynamics whereby personality traits and situational cues have their effects. The conditions under which mindsets are likely to shape career outcomes are outlined. Finally, implications for mindsets, personality, and career theory, research, and practice are discussed."
Bertoni Fabio,D'Adda Grilli,04/01/2018,anglais,Self-selection of entrepreneurial firms in thin venture capital markets,"Research Summary: We develop a two-step selection model between entrepreneurial ventures and venture capital (VC) investors in a thin VC market. The model predicts that in a thin VC market, the availability of VC reduces the propensity of firms to self-select into the market for VC (demand-side selection) but not the probability that firms entering the market for VC will receive financing (supply-side selection). We test these predictions using survey-based data on 190 new technology-based firms in Italy during the late 1990s and early 2000s. The empirical evidence supports the predictions of the model. Managerial Summary: Venture capital (VC) is an important ingredient of an environment that is conducive to the birth and the growth of entrepreneurial ventures, but VC markets are often highly local and thin in terms of participants. We show that the scarcity of VC supply may cause a drop in the demand for VC because entrepreneurs, anticipating that competition for VC money will be tough, will not seek VC in the first place. The more a market is thin, the more the demand-side selection is likely to become more important than the supply-side selection of VC investors. Demand-side selection may involve a significant number of otherwise good targets for VC investment, which will not be in the radar of VC investors. In turn, this may deter new VC investors from entering the local market, thus creating a vicious cycle that raises concerns for both policy makers and VC general partners."

The study reflects on the key challenges posited by this initiative and suggests key learnings and the way forward for PMJDY by comparing it with three financial inclusion models, namely, M-PESA Model (Kenya), Banking Agent Model (Mexico) and the Bolsa Familia Program (Brazil). The paper concludes by giving recommendations to improve the PMJDY scheme that will eventually further the mission of financial inclusion in India."
Andrieu Guillaume,Groh,01/01/2018,anglais,Specialist versus Generalist Investors,"We model an entrepreneur’s selection of either an active (specialist) or a passive (generalist) investor for an innovative venture that requires external equity for startup and expansion financing. We assume that the specialist investor provides better support but has a shorter investment horizon than the generalist. We particularly focus on the entrepreneur’s net present value (NPV)-maximizing contract, taking into account the specialist’s potential moral hazard. This latter might try selling his claim in a secondary transaction to an uninformed outside investor, even though the project is unsuccessful and should be abandoned. We show that the entrepreneur may trade off crucial contract parameters when seeking external financing. Either type of investor may be preferable, contingent on the allocation of control rights, the investor’s support quality and investment horizon, the chances of success, and the venture’s expected liquidation value."
Beugelsdijk Sjoerd,Kostova Kunst Spadafora Van Essen,01/01/2018,anglais,Cultural Distance and Firm Internationalization,"This paper presents the most comprehensive review and meta-analysis of the literature on cultural distance and firm internationalization to date. We analyze the effects of cultural distance on key strategic decisions throughout the entire process of internationalization. For the preinvestment stage, we examine the decisions on where to invest (location choice), how much to invest (degree of ownership), and how to organize the foreign expansion (entry and establishment mode). For the postinvestment stage, we examine the decisions of how to integrate the foreign subsidiary into the organization (transfer of practices) as well as the performance effects of cultural distance at both the subsidiary and the firm level. We find that firms are less likely to expand to culturally distant locations but if they do, they prefer greenfield investments and integrate subsidiaries more through transfer of management practices. Cultural distance does not seem to affect how much capital firms invest and whether they enter through a joint venture or full ownership. Interestingly, cultural distance has a strong negative effect on subsidiary performance but no effect on the performance of the whole multinational company. In addition, we find that the effects of cultural distance are not sensitive to time, but they are sensitive to the cultural framework used (e.g., Hofstede vs. Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness) and the home country of the company (developed vs. emerging market). Based on our study, we feel confident to offer some theoretical insights, recommendations for improving the validity and reliability of cultural-distance research, and ideas for future research."
Cruz Margarita,Beck Wezel,01/01/2018,anglais,Grown Local,"Geographic communities are often thought to support new ventures, particularly when newcomers are able to replicate incumbents’ characteristics. This paper elaborates on the conditions under which geographic communities may hinder the action of newcomers. Particular attention is dedicated to the case in which incumbents’ identities build on community traditions and rely on strong connectedness with community inhabitants, as these factors are difficult for newcomers to replicate. We explore this question within the context of market entries in the Franconian microbrewery industry. The results of our empirical analysis confirm that geographic communities exert an unfavorable effect on the entry of new organizations when incumbents are deeply attached to the community. Conversely, when incumbents relate poorly to the community, residential stability within the community displays a positive effect on founding."
Grosso Monica,Castaldo Grewal,01/01/2018,anglais,How Store Attributes Impact Shoppers’ Loyalty in Emerging Countries,"This paper takes a first step towards verifying a loyalty building model in the Indian retail sector. The results show that the intensity of some core loyalty model paths in developed countries, are confirmed within the Indian retail sector. One such path refers to the relationship between store loyalty and its main driver, customer satisfaction. Satisfaction comes mainly from the store environment and the perceived value according to customers, which is influenced by the retailers’ product assortment decisions. Surprisingly, promotions don’t have an impact on the perceived value, while the perceived value has only a small and negative impact on store loyalty."
Lee Brandon H.,Struben Bingham,01/01/2018,anglais,Collective Action and Market Formation,"Research summary While extant research recognizes the importance of collective action for market formation, it provides little understanding about when and to what extent collective action is important. In this paper, we develop a novel theoretical framework detailing what collective action problems and solutions arise in market formation and under what conditions. Our framework centers on the development of market infrastructure with three key factors that influence the nature and extent of collective action problems: perceived returns to contributions, excludability, and contribution substitutability. We apply our framework to diverse market formation contexts and derive a set of attendant propositions. Finally, we show how collective action problems and solutions evolve during market formation efforts and discuss how our framework contributes to strategic management, entrepreneurship, and organization literatures. Managerial summary This paper lays out the key considerations that players operating in new markets should contemplate when making nontrivial investments in those spaces. As collective action problems can thwart efforts to establish new markets we ask: When and under what conditions should market players collaborate rather than act independently? And if players collaborate, how should they coordinate to establish a new market? To address these research questions, we develop a novel generalizable framework of collective action in market formation. Our framework assesses the presence and type of collective action problems that hinder market formation and identifies potential solutions tied to those collective action problems."
Lindebaum Dirk,Perezts Andersson,01/01/2018,anglais,Why Books?,"Why should we write books? Why should we even bother reading them? And why on earth should anyone ‘waste’ their time reviewing books? These questions converge on a much larger question: what value do we, as social scientists, as well as those institutions within and outside academia that ‘evaluate’ our work, attach to books (see also Suddaby & Trank, 2013)? From an instrumental perspective, books seem to matter comparatively little in many countries and disciplines across the globe, because academic career progression is close to inconceivable in the absence of journal publications in so-called A* or 4* journals. As Gabriel notes, publishing academic articles ‘is now a game in which high performance forges careers and sustains departmental reputations hyped up on the back of publication and citation “hits”’ (Gabriel, 2017b). Socialization of academics, especially PhD students and early career researchers, follows (often) perverse incentives (Edwards & Roy, 2016) that influence publication strategies and choices in favour of articles rather than books. However, as book review editors and as authors ourselves, our view is that books occupy a significant intellectual space in the social sciences. Indeed, this has been recognized by EGOS when they introduced the EGOS Book Awards in 2017 to celebrate the linguistic diversity of scholarship in the field of organization studies performed with the depth and richness of detail afforded by a monograph’ (EGOS website). Over the next few months, book reviews of the short-listed books for that award will be published, along with the first reviews that the new editorial team solicited. As a medium to pursue knowledge and truth, books intrinsically matter because they provide vital space to develop theoretical, empirical and practical insights in depth and scopes that standard and often formulaic 40-page journal articles are less able to cater for. In times when the speed of life ceaselessly appears to accelerate, when the interactions between the social, natural and technological environments become more complex (Barrat, 2013; Helbing et al., 2017; Savory, 1999), we underscore the potential of books to allow and encourage the development of ‘grander’ ideas to respond to ‘grander’ challenges that we face in organizations and wider society. In addition, books proffer an alternative publication avenue when there is concern that the peer review process of top-tier journals (with all its benefits) may eventually eliminate an idea’s creative and unorthodox potential to challenge existing debates, perhaps rekindle them, or open up new theoretical debates. The book may then constitute a living attempt in ‘daring to know’, or ‘the attitude or spirit by which enquiry [is] being undertaken’ as opposed to the mere content of knowledge claims (Holt & den Hond, 2013, p. 1587). While we know that for some scholars reading academic books can amount to a luxury indulgence given the time pressure many of us face, for us it has often been the case that we publish not despite of reading books, but because of it."
Ocasio William,Laamanen Vaara,01/01/2018,anglais,Communication and Attention Dynamics,"Research summary The attention-based view (ABV) has highlighted the role of organizational attention in strategic decision-making and adaptation. The tendency to view communication channels as “pipes and prisms” for information processing has, however, limited its ability to address strategic change. We propose a broader role for communication as a process by which actors can attend to and engage with organizational and environmental issues and initiatives and argue that such a view can significantly advance understanding of strategic change. On this basis, we offer suggestions for future research on communication practices, vocabularies, rhetorical tactics, and talk and text in shaping organizational attention in strategic change. We also maintain that this enhanced view of the ABV can help advance research on dynamic capabilities, strategy processes, strategy-as-practice, and behavioral strategy. Managerial summary To further enhance our capabilities to manage strategic change and renewal processes in organizations, we need a better understanding of how to manage organizational attention. In this paper, we highlight the importance of understanding the role of communication and discuss the use of different communication practices, vocabularies, rhetorical tactics, and talk and text as possible levers that can be used to dynamically shape organizational attention. We call for further research to advance the understanding of how these levers can be used to influence the ways in which different sets of strategic issues, initiatives, and action alternatives are handled. We believe that such an enhanced view of organizational attention can enable the development of new, improved strategy practices to manage strategic change and renewal processes."
Lamine Wadid,Fayolle Jack Byrne,26/12/2017,anglais,The role of materially heterogeneous entities in the entrepreneurial network,"Few researchers have examined empirically the dynamics of human–non-human networking and its importance for strategic outcomes, particularly in the field of entrepreneurship. In this paper, we use Actor-Network Theory to observe and investigate the role of materially heterogeneous entities in the entrepreneurial network. Building on the results of a four-year, multi-case study, this paper describes how an entrepreneurial network, beyond its social nature, is also a socio-material constellation. The symmetric treatment of human and non-human actors enables us to move away from the figure of the heroic entrepreneur. Our findings reveal various roles that the heterogeneity of actor-networks can play in the entrepreneurial process. We see on the one hand their power to attract and recruit new allies when they are aligned with the entrepreneur's vision, and on the other their ability to repel and block the new venture creation process when they fail to effectively translate what the entrepreneur has in mind."

Bettinazzi Emanuele Luca Maria,Zollo,01/12/2017,anglais,Stakeholder orientation and acquisition performance,"Research summary: In this paper, we study how a firm’s stakeholder orientation affects the performance of its corporate acquisitions. We depart from prior literature and suggest that orientations towards employees, customers, suppliers and local communities will affect long-term acquisition performance both directly and through its interactions with process characteristics, such as pre- acquisition relatedness and post-acquisition integration. Analyses of data on a sample of 1,884 acquisitions show overall a positive association between acquirers’ stakeholder orientation and acquisition performance. In addition, we find support for a positive moderation of business relatedness on the performance impacts of stakeholder orientation. Structural integration has a similarly positive moderation effect only for some of the stakeholder categories. Managerial summary: Does collaboration with stakeholders during an acquisition pay off in terms of performance? The results of this research show that it is worth engaging stakeholders during the M&A process, but that the efficacy of involvement practices may depend on the type of stakeholders and the characteristics of the acquisition. While acquiring firms that take account of suppliers and local communities consistently over-perform in their acquisitions, the inclusion of employees might be not beneficial (and even harmful) when the target firm operates in a dissimilar business or when managers do not plan to maintain it as a separate entity."
Giovannini Michela,Huybrechts,01/12/2017,anglais,How inclusive is inclusive recycling?,"Inclusive recycling is the inspiring slogan of a project relying on a cross-sector (public–private–civil society) partnership implemented in Latin America with the objective to improve the socioeconomic conditions of recyclers. Through a qualitative study in Santiago de Chile, this paper seeks to understand how inclusive inclusive recycling is, by assessing how organised recyclers perceive the goals, the process, and the outcomes of this project. The main findings converge in observing a general low inclusion of recyclers, but they also enable to decompose the notion of inclusion into three dimensions: “inclusive goals” refers to the extent to which the goals of the recyclers are taken into account when designing the collaboration project; “inclusive process” refers to the extent to which recyclers are involved in the process of implementing the project; and “inclusive outcomes” refers to the capacity of the partnership to acknowledge the achievements of recyclers organisations before (and during) the project and to take into account the ongoing local dynamics when evaluating the project. These findings contribute to better understand the position and challenges of recyclers in this type of partnership and more generally to shed light on the potential power imbalance in waste management cross-sector partnerships."
Keith David R.,Sterman Struben,01/12/2017,anglais,Supply constraints and waitlists in new product diffusion,"Constraints on production capacity adjustment present a strategic and operational problem for managers launching products when demand is uncertain. Stock‐outs can be costly if demand exceeds available product supply, as sales are deferred or lost when prospective customers are waitlisted. Recent research on diffusion under supply constraints has analyzed launch strategies to minimize the chance of stock‐outs. Others suggest that waitlisted buyers generate social exposure that can boost customer demand and shape the diffusion process. We develop a generalized model of new product diffusion under supply constraints that explicitly accounts for endogenous customer waitlisting and waitlist‐generated word‐of‐mouth. We estimate the model for a prominent example of waitlisting, the launch of the Toyota Prius hybrid‐electric vehicle in the U.S.A., finding evidence of positive word‐of‐mouth from waitlisted buyers. Inclusion of endogenous supply constraints and waitlisting also alters the estimated contribution of marketing and adopter word‐of‐mouth."
Kornberger Martin,,01/12/2017,anglais,The Values of Strategy,"The concept of value is held dear by strategy theorists and practitioners alike as they share a concern about value creation, value propositions, value add, value chains, shareholder value and a plethora of other value constructs. Yet, despite its centrality, the concept of value has attracted limited attention in strategy scholarship. Most commonly, notions of value as profit or utility, inherited from economic theory, are assumed rather than analyzed. This paper advances the discussion of value in the strategy discourse by conceptualizing value as a correlate of valuation practices. Following this view, value is neither understood as the property of an object nor as a subjective preference; rather, values are constituted through valuation practices including rankings, ratings, awards, reviews and other valuation mechanisms that bestow values upon things in the first place. The paper explores this idea through analyzing valuation practices and their constitutive mechanisms; and it exploits this idea for the conceptualization of rivalry and strategic agency. The learnings are two-fold: because goods are ordered, hierarchized and “appreciated” by consumers, critics, competitors and others through mediating valuation practices, it follows that (1) rivalry takes place at the level of valuation practices as they constitute the spaces in which accounts of worth are constructed and contested; and that (2) strategic agency may be understood in relation to an actor’s capacity to cope with and influence these valuation practices."
Laffineur Catherine,Barbosa Fayolle NZIALI,01/12/2017,anglais,Active labor market programs’ effects on entrepreneurship and unemployment,"Many countries are turning to active labor market programs (ALMP) to increase individuals’ incentive to start a business and to reduce unemployment, but research on the effectiveness of such programs has produced mixed results and is still inconclusive at the macroeconomic level. This article examines the importance of ALMP targeted at entrepreneurship to explain cross-country differences in aggregate entrepreneurship rate. By using GEM data over the period 2002–2013 on OECD countries, our results show a positive impact of ALMP on the rate of necessity entrepreneurship but no significant effect on the rate of opportunity entrepreneurship. We further established that generous unemployment benefits reduce the positive outcome of ALMP on the aggregate rate of necessity entrepreneurship. Moreover, because most businesses started out of necessity do not create new jobs, we find that the economic spin-off of such programs in terms of unemployment reduction is very limited."

As an open ending, we formulate suggestions for future work and action research, with a focus on implementation, fruitful topics, and methodological issues."
Shoaib Farooq Muhammad,Salam Jaafar Fayolle Ayupp Radovic-Markovic Sajid,01/12/2017,anglais,Acceptance and use of lecture capture system (LCS) in executive business studies,"Purpose Adoption of latest technological advancements (e.g. lecture capture system) is a hallmark of market-driven private universities. Among many other distinguishing features, lecture capture system (LCS) is the one which is being offered to enhance the flexibility of learning environment for attracting executive business students. Majority of foreign universities are offering the facility of lecture capture system (LCS) to their students in offshore campuses established in Malaysia. Yet, very petite is known about perception and behaviour of executive business students towards acceptance and use of this facility. Therefore, in order to bridge the identified gap in academic literature, this study is an effort to explore the causal relationship between existing constructs of extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2), personal innovativeness (PI), intention and use behaviour towards lecture capture system (LCS). Moreover, this study is aimed to extend the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) by introducing a new variable namely personal innovativeness (PI) in the domain of information technology (IT). Design/methodology/approach SmartPLS-3.2.3 was employed for data analysis and all PLS related calculations. For this purpose, a self-administered questionnaire was designed to collect data regarding acceptance and use behaviour towards lecture capture system (LCS). A sample size of 481 responses from executive business students, who were enrolled in offshore campuses of five selected foreign universities in Malaysia, was used for testing the proposed theoretical model. Findings The results of structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, price value, hedonic motivation, habit and personal innovative (PI) in the domain of information technology (IT) have significant positive influence on acceptance and use of lecture capture system (LCS) in executive business students. Unique to this study is that, findings of this study have highlighted personal innovativeness (PI) in the domain of information technology (IT) as an important factor that affects intention and use behaviour towards lecture capture system (LCS) in executive business student. Practical implications By validating and extending the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2), findings of this study provide a number of practical implications along with a comprehensive, robust and useful framework for universities to successfully implement technological advancements, such as lecture capture system (LCS) to enhance overall learning outcomes. Originality/value By investigating the factors determining acceptance and use of lecture capture system (LCS) in executive business students, using a partial least square (PLS) based structural equation modeling (SEM) approach, this study makes a sizeable theoretical, methodological and contextual contribution to the overall body of knowledge."
Balogun Julia,Fahy Vaara,28/11/2017,anglais,The interplay between HQ legitimation and subsidiary legitimacy judgments in HQ relocation,"This paper marks a departure from the focus on external stakeholders in much research on legitimacy and multinational corporations, adopting a social psychological approach to study how MNCs build internal legitimacy for controversial decisions with their subsidiaries. We explore this through a longitudinal, real-time qualitative case study of a regional office relocation, since office relocations represent rare yet significant strategic decisions. We analyze the interplay between the legitimation strategies of senior managers and subsidiary legitimacy judgments, based in instrumental, relational, and moral considerations, and how the relationship between the two develops over time. From this analysis, we derive inductively a process model that reveals the dynamics of building internal legitimacy with subsidiaries, and how an MNC moves on even in the absence of full legitimacy, when dealing with controversial MNC decisions. The model highlights two important dynamics. The first is a dynamic between legitimation strategies and legitimacy judgments and how this is influenced by local subsidiary contexts. The second is a temporal dynamic in how both the legitimation strategies and legitimacy judgments evolve over time. Our model contributes to research on legitimacy in MNCs, what we know about tensions that characterize MNC–subunit relationships, and research on headquarters relocation."
Barisione Mauro,Michailidou Airoldi,21/11/2017,anglais,Understanding a digital movement of opinion,"Recent work on digital political engagement has extensively shown that social media platforms enhance political participation and collective action. However, the idea that citizen voice through social media can give rise, under given conditions, to a specific digital force combining properties of social movements and public opinion has received less attention. We fill this gap by analysing the digital discussion around the Twitter hashtag #RefugeesWelcome as a case of ‘digital movement of opinion’ (DMO). When the refugee crisis erupted in 2015, an extraordinary wave of empathy characterized the publics’ reactions in key European hosting countries, especially as a result of viral images portraying refugee children as the main victims. Using a triangulation of network, content and metadata analysis, we find that this DMO was driven primarily by social media elites whose tweets were then echoed by masses of isolated users. We then test the post-DMO status of the hashtag-sphere after a potentially antithetical shock such as the November 2015 Paris terrorist attacks, which polarized the network public. Overall, we argue that the concept of DMO provides a heuristically useful tool for future research on new forms of digital citizen participation."
Zhu Andy Yunlong,Zedtwitz Assimakopoulos,13/11/2017,anglais,Responsible Product Innovation,"This book analyses the relationships among product safety strategy and culture, concurrent engineering, new product development (NPD) processes and product safety performance. Product safety is a matter of enormous economic and societal concern, given the safety risks to consumers and the financial risks to producers. Nevertheless, a thorough conceptual understanding of the effects of NPD policies and practices is still largely missing, as several large-scale trends have made clarifying the role of product safety in its socio-economic context difficult, including: the rise of consumerism and the shift in the balance of power from manufacturers to customers and regulators; the internationalization of value chains and the fragmentation of markets worldwide; and technological change leading to a sophistication of products that rendered average consumers increasingly unaware of risk and potential accidents. This volume sets out to close the gaps among research, practice and policy, with an emphasis on advocating responsible product innovation. Through an in-depth study of the durable juvenile products industry, the authors discover important relationships, for example that top management involvement, safety-first culture and robust NPD processes are paramount in increasing product safety and decreasing product recalls in firms. On the other end of the spectrum, concurrent engineering does not automatically lead to product safety, they found no “magic bullet” through which product safety can be tied to the use of a particular tool, skill, or practice. Offering a dynamic framework for aligning the interests of multiple stakeholders, including manufacturers, regulators, and consumers, the authors provide a clearer understanding of product safety and its implications for scholars, students, policy makers, and practitioners in the areas of innovation management, product management, R&D management, and responsible research and innovation."
Kornberger Martin,Leixnering Meyer Hoellerer,08/11/2017,anglais,Rethinking the sharing economy,"Our article focuses on a non-standard sharing example that harbors the potential to disrupt received wisdom on the sharing economy. Although, originally, entering the field to analyze, broadly from a governance perspective, how the 2015 refugee crisis was handled in Vienna, Austria, we found that the non-governmental organization Train of Hope—labeled as a ‘citizen start-up’ by the City of Vienna officials—played an outstanding role in mastering the crisis. In a blog post during his visit in Vienna at the time, and experiencing the refugee crisis first-hand, it was actually Henry Mintzberg who suggested reading the phenomenon as part of the ‘sharing economy’. Continuing this innovative line of thought, we argue that our unusual case is in fact an excellent opportunity to discover important aspects about both the nature and organization of sharing. First, we uncover an additional dimension of sharing beyond the material sharing of resources (i.e., the economic dimension): the sharing of a distinct concern (i.e., the moral dimension of sharing). Our discovery exemplifies such a moral dimension that is rather different from the status quo materialistic treatments focusing on economic transactions and property rights arguments. Second, we hold that a particular form of organizing facilitates the sharing economy: the sharing economy organization (SEO). This particular organizational form is distinctive—at the same time selectively borrowing and skillfully combining features from platform organizations (e.g., use of technology as an intermediary for exchange and effective coordination, ability to tap into external resources) and social movements (e.g., mobilization, shared identity, collective action). It is a key quality of this form of organization to enable the balancing of the two dimensions inherent in the nature of sharing: economic and moral. Our article contributes to this special issue of the Academy of Management Discoveries by highlighting and explaining the two-fold economic and moral nature of sharing and the organization of sharing between movement and platform."
Ivens Björn Sven,Leischnig Pardo Niersbach,06/11/2017,anglais,Key account management as a firm capability,"Firms manage numerous inter-organizational relationships. Key account management (KAM) is a concept used to manage a specific subset of these relationships, i.e. a supplier firm's relationships with strategically important customers. Scholars have studied different elements of KAM such as actors, resources, or relationships. Surprisingly few studies discuss the link between KAM and competitive advantage. By adopting a capability perspective on KAM, we seek to develop a theoretical basis to better explain its performance-implications. The capability perspective is compatible with extant approaches and complements them with new arguments concerning the value that a KAM system has in competition. The purpose of our article is to develop a conceptual model of a supplier firm's KAM capability and to indicate avenues for future research."
Forgues Bernard,May,01/11/2017,anglais,Message in a Bottle,"A multimodal perspective highlights the importance of attending to the different modes, mostly verbal and visual, which organizations use when conveying messages. We complement this perspective by adding an additional layer, namely the medium through which messages appear. We suggest that organizations can fine-tune messages not only by playing with possible interactions across modes, but also across media. We build our reasoning around the communication of identity claims. Specifically, we are interested in how identity elements are referenced in verbal and visual modes of meaning making, and how these modes interrelate both with one another and with the respective channels of communication on which they appear. We propose that organizations differentially select identity elements across diverse media and draw on specific identity elements modally in their quest for legitimate distinctiveness. We propose three ways in which multimodal identity claims interact: intensifying, in which messages draw from the same theme to reinforce claims; complementing, in which messages complement each other to enhance meaning; and transposing, in which a dominant theme in one message is transposed into another theme elsewhere. We provide an illustration with identity claims made by single-malt Scotch whisky distilleries."
Pagani Margherita,Pardo,01/11/2017,anglais,The impact of digital technology on relationships in a business network,"This paper examines the impact of digitalization - the adoption of Internet-connected digital technologies and applications by companies - on B2B exchanges. While B2C exchanges are the subject of numerous studies on the transformations brought by the digital technologies, B2B exchanges are far less analyzed. Building on a conceptualization of exchanges between companies as made of activity links, resource ties, and actor bonds, this paper offers to identify three types of “digitalization” according to the nature of the most deeply impacted link. Five cases of digitization in different industrial sectors and five companies providing digital solutions for businesses illustrate these three types. This typology provides an alternative to analyses based on the nature of digital systems used by B2B companies."
Bouchard Véronique,Fayolle,31/10/2017,anglais,Corporate Entrepreneurship,"Since its emergence in the early eighties, the subject of Corporate Entrepreneurship has gained relevance as a subject of academic research and in the world of business practice. Yet corporate entrepreneurship remains an elusive notion. Written by two entrepreneurship experts this practical book introduces the field and highlights the importance of balancing the encouragement of new venture style behaviour with managing an established firm. Covering both theory and practice, the book also switches between the perspective of the individual intrapraneur and the organization to provide the key concepts and issues tied to the various facets of corporate entrepreneurship. The inclusion of key topics such as corporate venturing and open innovation, ensures that this text is required reading for entrepreneurship students globally."
Zou Bipan,Gong Xu Yuan,15/10/2017,anglais,Assignment rules in robotic mobile fulfilment systems for online retailers,"We study robotic mobile fulfilment systems for online retailers, where products are stored in movable shelves and robots transport shelves. While previous studies assume random assignment rule of workstations to robots, we propose an assignment rule based on handling speeds of workstations and design a neighbourhood search algorithm to find a near optimal assignment rule. We build semi-open queueing networks and use a two-phase approximate approach for performance estimation. We first replace workstation service processes by a composite service node and then solve the model by the matrix-geometric method. Simulations are used to validate the analytical models. Numerical experiments are conducted to compare random, handling-speeds-based, near optimal and optimal assignment rules, in terms of retrieval throughput time. The results show that the random assignment rule is not a good choice, the handling-speeds-based assignment rule significantly outperforms the random assignment rule when the workers have large handling time difference, and the neighbourhood search approach can provide an assignment rule that is very close to the optimal one, using a much shorter time. Moreover, we design the shelf blocks under the examined assignment rules, and find that the optimal width of shelf block decreases with the width to length ratio."

We argue that there is a need for a more fine-grained understanding of the “human side,” which requires conceptualizing M&As as practice-oriented processes. Drawing on the practice approach, we outline avenues for further research on the “human side” of global M&As. The research directions include (1) multilayered identity dynamics, (2) emotional processes, (3) participation and change agency, (4) resistance, (5) human resource management (HRM) practices and tools, and (6) new forms of communication."

Bozionelos Nikos,Singh,01/10/2017,anglais,The relationship of emotional intelligence with task and contextual performance,"The relationship of emotional intelligence (EI) with job performance was investigated in 188 individuals working as expatriates. Job performance was considered in terms of task and contextual performance - helping (OCB-H) and voice (OCB-V) organizational citizenship behaviours - and was assessed by line managers. In line with expectations, most identified relationships were of quadratic U-shaped form. Specifically, all three relationships of the global EI construct, and eight out of the 11 identified relationships of its four facets, were of U-shape. That included the relationships of all four EI facets with task performance, and the relationships of two dimensions, self-emotional appraisal (SEA) and regulation of emotion (ROE) with OCB-H and with OCB-V. The findings illustrate the link of global EI and its facets with contextual performance apart from task performance that has been the primary focus of research thus far. The findings also suggest that although those with the highest scores on EI receive the strongest job performance ratings those who are most disadvantaged in terms of job performance are not the lowest EI scorers but rather those who find themselves near the middle of the EI scores continuum."

A research model was developed establishing the mediating role of trust and perceived risks. The results of the empirical survey (n = 900) show that the relationship between privacy concerns and purchasing intention is partially mediated by trust, perceived risk, and attitude. The results of a multi-group analysis show a different impact of privacy concerns on trust and perceived risks for males and females. Implications and further research suggestions are presented."
Wezel Filippo Carlo,Ruef,01/10/2017,anglais,Agents with Principles,"Principal-agent problems plagued early modern corporations. The existing literature emphasizes the potential benefits provided by private trade in aligning the interests of company agents to those of their principals. We contribute to this line of work by analyzing the organizational and social mechanisms that may help address principal-agent problems in the presence of private trading opportunities. Drawing on personnel records of more than half a million seafarers employed by the Dutch East India Company (VOC) over nearly a century, we show that monitoring was effective in reducing desertion when private trade was conceived as a market activity subordinated to hierarchy. Social bonds were more effective in preventing desertion when the company elevated private trade above hierarchy. Our analysis clarifies how early corporations could maintain control over a geographically dispersed and diverse labor force in the absence of modern tools of organizational governance."

Courpasson David,Younes,22/09/2017,anglais,Double or Quits,"Most studies on the links between secrecy and creativity have focused on individual sources of creativity and the impact of organizational management on creative initiatives. However, because of their very focus on individual practices of concealment and personal creative capacities, they have paid scant attention to collective interactions occurring around secrets. In this paper, we illuminate some mechanisms through which the creative work achieved in secret by scientists is enhanced by the exceptional character of their situation within the company. Coping with these exceptional circumstances leads the group to increase commitment, cohesion and efficiency. We theorize creativity as a result of the multiplication of social interactions among individuals and the social consequences of working and cooperating in secret. We show that secrecy can help rather than be detrimental to organizations when it is analysed as a social fabric of interactions around work and common feelings triggered by the risks of working in secret."
Arregle Jean-Luc,Duran Hitt Van Essen,01/09/2017,anglais,Why Is Family Firms' Internationalization Unique?,"Despite its importance, there is no clear understanding of the uniqueness of family firms' internationalization. This article sheds new light on this issue with a meta-analysis of 76 studies covering 41 countries. We show that the considerable study and cross-country differences in the relationship between family firm and internationalization are explained by the roles of family control, internationalization types, and home countries' institutional contexts (i.e., minority shareholders protection and generalized trust of people from other countries). Therefore, we examine the existing divergent results using theories that reconcile some of these mixed findings and shed light on family firms' specific internationalization challenges."

We present the results of these analyses on the effects of start-up support programmes and the moderating role of the institutional framework, in terms of quantity and quality, on entrepreneurial activity within a country, and on unemployment reduction. Our results probably appear counter-intuitive, but as well as being based on solid methodology with a longitudinal design, they do make sense and they lead to very clear practical implications that we think could be usefully taken into account in future consideration of public policy on entrepreneurship and unemployment reduction."
Bommier Antoine,Kochov Le Grand,01/09/2017,anglais,On Monotone Recursive Preferences,"We explore the set of preferences defined over temporal lotteries in an infinite horizon setting. We provide utility representations for all preferences that are both recursive and monotone. Our results indicate that the class of monotone recursive preferences includes Uzawa–Epstein preferences and risk-sensitive preferences, but leaves aside several of the recursive models suggested by Epstein and Zin (1989) and Weil (1990). Our representation result is derived in great generality using Lundberg’s (1982, 1985) work on functional equations."
Carney Michael,Duran Van Essen Shapiro,01/09/2017,anglais,"Family firms, internationalization, and national competitiveness","We revisit the question of family firms (FFs) and their capacity for internationalization, and link it to the literature on national competitiveness. We draw widely on the FF competitive advantage and internationalization literature to argue that FFs’ organizing preferences and capabilities will typically support exporting and that these same organizing preferences will mitigate against outward FDI, two dimensions of national competitiveness. Using the logic of aggregation, we hypothesize that family firm prevalence (FFP), measured at the country level, negatively moderates a series of country-level variables associated with country outward FDI, and positively moderates a series of variables associated with country exports.We develop a unique dataset on FFP across countries using a novel method in which we extract estimates from from both published and unpublished academic studies. We develop empirical tests that are rooted in Porter's Competitive Advantage of Nations (Porter, 1990), and its extensions in the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI). Our results provide consistent confirmation of the positive moderator effect of FFP on country export performance hypothesis, but contrary to expectation, higher FFP in a country has a null or positive effect on outward FDI at the country level, thus suggesting a more nuanced view of FF strengths and weaknesses. We conclude by discussing the implications of these results for both the competitiveness and the FF literatures."
Clarke Jean,Holt,01/09/2017,anglais,Imagery of ad-venture,"We examine how visual metaphor can reveal the tacit assumptions entrepreneurs use to make sense of their lives. While metaphor is often equated with linguistic metaphor, here we argue that metaphors created through the modality of drawing can offer a more nuanced insight into how entrepreneurs make sense of their entrepreneurial identity. From an analysis of images drawn by entrepreneurs and accompanying interviews, metaphors emerge that are much more complex, nuanced and messy than their linguistic equivalents. The images allow the entrepreneurs to isolate salient meanings about being in business, but refrain from simplifying what remains a multifaceted and at times contradictory and paradoxical experience."
Courpasson David,,01/09/2017,anglais,Beyond the Hidden/Public Resistance Divide,"In recent decades, organizational research on resistance has been largely characterized by a strict divide between hidden and public forms of resistance. We contend that this division impedes a full understanding of how resistance can be efficacious. We suggest that hidden and public forms of resistance are in fact interrelated and mutually reinforced along processes of struggle. In order to study this relationship, we analyze the four-and-a-half-year struggle of a group of dismissed employees against their former employer. This study aims to contribute to the literature in three ways. First, we show that the development of public resistance is nourished by discrete individualistic and non-confrontational expressions of dissent. Second, we demonstrate how the efficacy of resistance is influenced by the meaningfulness of the resisting space constituted by the blog, because of the intricacies between private lives and public roles. Finally, we show that the outcome of resistance is also influenced by the politics of the resisters themselves. We analyze resistance as a dynamic and ambivalent process during which the resisting group can disagree on strategy, thus triggering diverging initiatives that can develop into radicalization."
Godinho Pedro,Moutinho Pagani,01/09/2017,anglais,A Memetic Algorithm for Maximizing Earned Attention in Social Media,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to propose a measure for earned attention and a model and procedure for the maximization of earned attention by a company over a period of time. Design/methodology/approach Utility functions are used as the base of the earned attention measure. An evolutionary algorithm - a memetic algorithm - is applied to identifying strategies that aim to maximize earned attention. Computational analysis is performed resorting to simulated data, and the memetic algorithm is assessed through the comparison with a standard steepest ascent heuristic. Findings The shape of the utility functions considered in the model has a huge impact on the characteristics of the best strategies, with actions focused on increasing a single variable being preferred in case of constant marginal utility, and more balanced strategies having a better performance in the case of decreasing marginal utility. The memetic algorithm is shown to have a much better performance that the steepest ascent procedure. Originality/value A new mathematical model for earned attention is proposed, and an approach that has few applications in business problems - a memetic algorithm - is tailored to the model and applied to identify solutions."
Hasel Markus,Grover,01/09/2017,anglais,An Integrative Model of Trust and Leadership,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the interplay between different streams of trust and leadership and their impact on motivation and performance. The model answers recent calls for a better understanding of underlying mechanisms in these interactions. Design/methodology/approach The authors drew from contemporary leadership and trust theories to develop ten propositions teasing out how specific person- and role-oriented leadership behaviors interact with calculus-, identification-, knowledge-based trust, motivation, and performance. Findings The model accentuates the complexity of the interactions between trust, leadership, and follower outcomes. It guides future empirical research to unravel these intricate relations and accentuates their complexity. Research limitations/implications The ten propositions act as guidelines in mastering the complex art of leadership by understanding how behaviors affect followers. An important limitation originates in the detailed analysis of leadership and trust. Focusing on specific leadership behaviors and trust types leaves further scope for future research into additional behaviors and cofounding variables to arrive at a more holistic picture of the underlying mechanisms that make or break an effective leader. Originality/value Contemporary theories on leadership and trust frequently view the different streams as overall constructs in lieu of multi-faceted phenomena. The model is a first of its kind in that it fuses contemporary leadership and trust theory to develop a set of propositions based on specific interactions between leadership behaviors and different forms of trust."

We critically explore scholarship that examines resistance in terms of its manifestations and political intent or impact. We offer four fields of possibility for resistance scholarship: individual infrapolitics, collective infrapolitics, insubordination, and insurrection (the “four I’s” of resistance). We conclude by considering the relationship between resistance theory and praxis, and pose four questions, or provocations, for stimulating future resistance research and practice."
Rahimi Mohammad,Baboli Rekik,01/09/2017,anglais,Inventory Routing Problem for Perishable Products by Considering Customer Satisfaction and Green Criteria,"This paper presents a new model for Inventory Routing Problem (IRP) considering simultaneously economic criteria, customer satisfaction level and environmental aspect for perishable products with expiration date. For this consideration, a multi-objective mathematical model has been developed. The first objective focuses on traditional inventory and distribution costs as well as recycling cost of perished products. The second objective concerns in customer satisfaction by minimization of three criteria, such as the number of delays (deliver after time windows), the quantity of backordered, and the frequency of backorders. The third objective considers Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission, produced by different IRP activities. The proposed model is also enabled to investigate the possibility of using diesel and electrical vehicles in urban transportation. In order to cope with complexity of proposed model, Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is tuned and applied. Finally, sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the effects of variation of customer satisfaction and green aspects in economic side."

We contend that three types of agency relationships constitute B2N alliances: the relationship between the ﬁrm’s managers and B2N alliance employees; the relationship between the NGO’s managers and the B2N alliance employees; and the novel ‘claimed principal-agent relationship’ involving the external beneﬁciary, the NGO’s mana gers and the alliance employees. We argue that B2N alliances’ three types of agency problems stem from (1) the relative emphasis on public vs. private goods, both at the employee and at the partner levels, and (2) the level of the external beneﬁciary’s voice. We then predict the mechanisms to mitigate these problems: hiring altruistic over self-interested individuals; narrowly spe cifying the employees’ activities; emphasizing input-based and intrinsic incentive mechanisms; and investing signiﬁcantly into non-intrusive monitoring mechanisms."

Conceptually, apart from different strands of institutional thought, they make particular use of the sociology of professions and the concept of boundary objects in the social studies of science and technology. By applying network analysis, they show the emergence of a new field structure where experts, consultants, ratings and rankings increasingly shape the field.

Leischnig Alexander,Ivens Niersbach Pardo,24/08/2017,anglais,Mind the gap,"Today, many firms develop and implement key account management (KAM) programs to manage the relationships with strategically important customers. The implementation of KAM programs requires the configuration of special activities, actors, and resources dedicated to key accounts, which poses major challenges for managerial practice. Firms often underestimate the fundamental organizational change required for a successful implementation of KAM. The objective of this article is to advance extant knowledge on KAM by developing a framework that outlines essential processes to assess and diagnose barriers to KAM implementation. In our article, we integrate extant knowledge on KAM organization and enactment, and we propose a four-step process model that links the concepts of embeddedness, differentiation, integration, and alignment. In addition, we illustrate our model in a case study analysis with a large-scale European industrial company. The findings of our study allow us to derive avenues for further research on KAM implementation as well as implications for management practice."
Rekik Yacine,Glock SYNTETOS,16/08/2017,anglais,Enriching demand forecasts with managerial information to improve inventory replenishment decisions,"This paper is concerned with analyzing and modelling the effects of judgmental adjustments to replenishment order quantities. Judgmentally adjusting replenishment quantities suggested by specialized (statistical) software packages is the norm in industry. Yet, to date, no studies have attempted to either analytically model this situation or practically characterize its implications in terms of ‘learning’. We consider a newsvendor setting where information available to managers is reflected in the form of a signal that may or may not be correct, and which may or may not be trusted. We show the analytical equivalence of adjusting an order quantity and deriving an entirely new one in light of a necessary update of the estimated demand distribution. Further, we assess the system’s behavior through a simulation experiment on theoretically generated data and we study how to foster learning to efficiently utilize managerial information. Judgmental adjustments are found to be beneficial even when the probability of a correct signal is not known. More generally, some interesting insights emerge into the practice of judgmentally adjusting order quantities."
Ben Mahmoud Jouini Sihem,Silberzahn Paris,01/08/2017,anglais,Resolving the commitment-flexibility dilemma in new technology ventures,"In their attempt to define radically new product–market pairs, according to the literature, new technology ventures (NTV) are confronted with an apparent dilemma. On the one hand, they should delay key commitments to remain flexible in the face of high uncertainty. On the other hand, commitments are necessary to enable learning and progress. Based on the longitudinal study of four NTVs, we find that the entrepreneurs resolve this dilemma by (i) defining their product and market progressively through iteration and learning, and by (ii) basing this progressive definition on stakeholders’ commitments. We analyse this approach and label it “commit and learn”. Following an inductive methodology, we suggest a conceptual framework to enhance the understanding of commitment as a multi-dimensional concept for new ventures."
Calcagno Riccardo,Giofré Urzi-Brancati,01/08/2017,anglais,"To trust is good, but to control is better","Using a survey of clients from one of the largest Italian banks, we find that investors with low level of trust in professional advisors seek financial counselling, but make their decisions autonomously. We investigate whether these investors exert some form of control over the recommendations they receive, and, if so, which one. Investors can push advisors to provide better recommendations either by asking for a second expert's opinion, such as in the case of credence services, or by monitoring closely the advisor's activity themselves. We find that three quarters of investors do not exert any control on advisors. Different types of financial competence – self-assessed or test-based – serve different purposes. The investors featuring higher self-assessed financial competence are more likely to control the advisor's activity. The mechanism through which investors exert control over the advisors’ activity depends instead on the investors’ degree of test-based financial literacy. Investors with high financial literacy directly monitor the advisors’ activity. Investors with low financial literacy are more likely to seek a second professional opinion in support of the recommendations previously received. Our findings suggest that improving investors financial knowledge may foster direct control of the advisor's activity. Moreover, facilitating the comparison between financial products by standardized and centralized information may be very effective to protect poorly literate investors."
Nekhili Mehdi,Nagati Chtioui Rebolledo,01/08/2017,anglais,Corporate social responsibility disclosure and market value,"We investigate the moderating role of family involvement in the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting and firm market value using a longitudinal archival data set in the French context. Our empirical results show that family firms report less information on their CSR duties than do nonfamily firms. However, market-based financial performance, as measured by Tobin’s q, is positively related to CSR disclosure for family firms and negatively related to CSR disclosure for nonfamily firms. Family firms would benefit greatly from communicating commitment to CSR; specifically, they could obtain shareholders’ endorsement more easily than nonfamily firms could."
Soenen Guillaume,Melkonian,01/08/2017,anglais,Fairness and commitment to change in M&As,"This paper examines the determinants of employees' affective commitment to change in the context of M&As. Based on the group engagement model (Tyler & Blader, 2000, 2003), we predicted that organizational identification with the newly formed organization mediates the positive impact of employees’ overall justice judgments and perceived change favorableness on affective commitment to change. We tested our predictions using data collected during an international merger. After controlling for country effects, results support our hypotheses. Implications for research and practice alike are discussed."
Moscarola Flavia Coda,Calcagno Fornero,23/07/2017,anglais,Too busy to stay at work,"Using a representative sample of Italian workers aged 55+, we survey their understanding of the recent (2011) pension reform and analyse their preference for anticipated retirement and availability to pay for exiting a year earlier. The preference for anticipated retirement is particularly strong for women and for workers who were obliged by the reform to postpone retirement. As for the “willingness to pay”, we find that women who are involved in informal care of children are available to pay significantly more than women who are not caregivers, and even more than men. In terms of policy, our findings point to the need of considering side effects of reforms and of integrating policy measures. In particular, when a pension system compensates for gaps in other welfare programs (like providing early retirement as a substitute for lack of public care services), its reform may cause social mismatches unless supplemented by appropriate changes in these other programs."
Batat Wided,Peter Vicdan Manna ULUSOY Ulusoy Hong,01/07/2017,anglais,Alternative food consumption (AFC),"This paper explores the factors that drive consumer demands for alternative food consumption (AFC) options in western society (i.e. plant-based, organic and local diets) as means to achieve sustainability and a state of food well-being. Specifically, we propose a holistic framework in order to identify factors that influence its adoption: idiocentric (functional, ideological and experiential) and allocentric (situational, sociocultural and institutional). The proposed framework provides a basis for discussion on how marketing can contribute to the establishment of AFC in western society and contribute to sustainability and food-well-being among low socio-economic status (SES) consumers. Marketing and public policy implications of this framework are discussed in light of food consumption by low SES consumers, a target particularly vulnerable to flawed states of food well-being."
Dattée Brice,,01/07/2017,anglais,Convex drops in technological substitutions,"In many empirical cases of technological substitution, the diffusion dynamics bifurcate and the sales of the incumbent technology suddenly shift from the smooth end-of-life pattern anticipated by classical diffusion models directly into the convex end-of-life phase. These sudden convex drops lead to significant differences in cumulative sales compared to forecasts used for selecting a firm’s technological capabilities. This paper develops an integrative model whose structure includes key interactions between performance trajectories, price dynamics, market heterogeneity, and information. Simulation results explain the underlying dynamics of convex drops, provide a boundary condition for the phenomenon, and extend the notion of demand heterogeneity."

However, the ease with which data can be acquired and disseminated, also thanks to the digital technologies, has led to many potential customers demonstrating growing concerns and ethical issues about disclosing personal information. On this topic it is difficult to make too many generalizations, since the cultural differences and the different country regulations seem to weigh significantly."
Hottegindre Géraldine,Loison Farjaudon,01/07/2017,anglais,Male and Female Auditors,"This article aims to explore the behavioural differences between male and female auditors with respect to professional ethics rules. We used factorial correspondence analysis to study disciplinary rulings issued against French statutory auditors between June 1989 and December 2008. Our results highlight significant gender-related behavioural differences between auditors regarding professional ethics. Male statutory auditors are more likely to exhibit behaviour that harms the image of the profession, while their female counterparts principally commit disciplinary offences relating to audit quality and to obstruction of professional peer-review controls. This study therefore shows that gender offers a relevant perspective for investigating differences in statutory auditor professional ethical behaviour. It is also a useful source of information for the profession in terms of increasing the effectiveness of its disciplinary processes."
Kornberger Martin,Pflueger Mouritsen,01/07/2017,anglais,Evaluative infrastructures,"Platform organizations such as Uber, eBay and Airbnb represent a growing disruptive phenomenon in contemporary capitalism, transforming economic organization, the nature of work, and the distribution of wealth. This paper investigates the accounting practices that underpin this new form of organizing, and in doing so confronts a significant challenge within the accounting literature: the need to escape what Hopwood (1996) describes as its “hierarchical consciousness”. In order to do so, this paper develops the concept of evaluative infrastructure which describes accounting practices that enable platform based organization. They are evaluative because they deploy a plethora of interacting devices, including rankings, ratings, reviews, and audits to establish orders of worth. They are infrastructures because they provide the invisible yet essential mechanisms for the flow of economic activity and exchange on platforms. Illustrating the concept of evaluative infrastructure with the example of eBay, the paper's contribution is to (1) provide an analytical vocabulary to capture the accounting practices underpinning platforms as new organizational forms, and in so doing (2) extend accounting scholars' analytical focus from hierarchical settings towards heterarchies. Conceptually, this shift from management accounting to evaluative infrastructures entails a focus on relationality (evaluative infrastructures do not represent or reference but relate things, people and ideas with each other); generativity (evaluative infrastructures do not territorialize objects but disclose new worlds); and new forms of control (evaluative infrastructures are not centres of calculation; rather, control is radically distributed, whilst power remains centralized)."
Smith Celina,Marti,01/07/2017,anglais,Attaining legitimacy in temporary business,"This work seeks to identify behavioral processes that new entrepreneurs can adopt to construct legitimacy in frequently-changing temporary business environments. Focusing on television content production in the UK, the study finds that new entrepreneurs exploit the varying roles that their projects can play and then sequence these in order to tailor the legitimacy they need to build their business. The paper draws on a five-year inductive study of 81 projects won by entrepreneurs of five new independent television production companies."
Wu Xiang,Gong XU CHU Zhang,01/07/2017,anglais,Dynamic Lot-Sizing Models with Pricing for New Products,"While previous dynamic lot-sizing (DLS) models mainly consider mature products, this study analyzes production planning decisions for new products. The demand dynamics caused by new product diffusion complicate production decisions for new products. We integrate DLS and discrete Bass models to provide optimal decisions for pricing and production planning problems. Moreover, we study the joint influence of product diffusion and pricing parameters on the DLS decisions. This leads to the following insights. First, coordinated production-pricing and dynamic pricing improve profitability. Second, the optimal pricing strategy is affected by market conditions. The penetration pricing strategy outperforms the skimming pricing strategy when consumers are less sensitive to relative price changes than to the introductory price, when the product diffuses slowly, or when the consumer initiative level is low. Otherwise, the latter outperforms the former. Finally, pricing strategies and product diffusion patterns reshape the cost structure of a firm. Coordinated decisions and dynamic pricing strategy substantially reduce the cost-revenue ratio, whereas an increase in the consumer initiative level or product diffusion speed can improve cost efficiency."
Yuan Zhe,XU Gong CHU Zhang,01/07/2017,anglais,Designing public storage warehouses with high demand for revenue maximisation,"The design of public storage warehouses needs to fit market segments to increase the average revenue in an environment of high demand. This paper presents a revenue model integrated with queuing and price-demand theories to solve the design and pricing problem for public storage warehouses. We consider two demand cases in the model, which are exponential demand and piecewise linear demand. We also develop a solution based on dynamic programming techniques to solve the problem. Using data from a warehouse, we conduct numerical experiments. Results show that our approach can improve the expected revenue of public storage warehouses with high demand by 16.6% on average. We further conduct sensitivity analysis on price, and investigate the relation between revenue and price."
Zhang Xing,Liu Chen Gong,01/07/2017,anglais,"Social capital, motivations, and knowledge sharing intention in health Q&A communities","Purpose Although health question-and-answer (Q&A) communities have become popular in recent years, only a few communities have successfully retained and motivated their members to share knowledge. The purpose of this paper is to focus on the ways by which social capital and motivation influence knowledge sharing intention from the perspectives of health professionals and normal users in health Q&A communities. Design/methodology/approach The developed theoretical model integrates individual motivation and social capital theories. On the basis of a sample comprising 363 members from health Q&A communities in China, the authors tested the hypotheses by using structural equation modeling. Findings This study empirically finds that social capital positively affects intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, which then positively influence the intention of health professionals and normal users to share knowledge. Motivations of members fully mediate the effects of social capital on knowledge sharing intention. Specifically, intrinsic motivation influences knowledge sharing intention more for health professionals than for normal users, whereas extrinsic motivation influences knowledge sharing intention more for normal users than for health professionals. Originality/value This study explores the factors that affect the intentions of sharing knowledge in health Q&A communities by integrating social capital and motivation theories. Individual motivations can then bridge social capital and knowledge sharing intention. The effects of the intrinsic and extrinsic motivations of two user types were further examined and compared. These findings can extend the understanding of the underlying drivers of intention to share knowledge in the context of e-health."

Why would the notion of everyday be interesting for understanding people’s experiences at work? How can we make sense of the myriad of disconnected actions, gestures and encounters that make the everyday? This essay takes its inspiration from Henri Lefebvre and Michel de Certeau’s specific investigations of everyday life to draw a picture of current workplaces; it aims to capture some particulars of symbolic and material life at work, as well as some representations of lived experiences that are shared by people at work. We defend a dialectical view of the everyday by showing the link between forces of alienation and forces of emancipation. We draw from interviews to suggest the extraordinary influence of the ordinary actions over our lives."
Mirzapour Al-E-Hashem Seyed Mohammad Javad,Rekik Mohammadi Hoseinhajlou,01/06/2017,anglais,A hybrid L-shaped method to solve a bi-objective stochastic transshipment-enabled inventory routing problem,"Recently, ‘greenness’ has become a very much needed condition in the transportation industry. In this study we develop a ‘green’, transshipment-enabled model for the Inventory Routing Problem (IRP), in a many-to-one distribution network where demand for each product is realistically assumed to be uncertain. The proposed framework is a bi-objective stochastic programming model. The first objective function aims to minimize the expected value of the supply chain costs including inevitable shortage costs. The second objective function aims to minimize the total quantity of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission produced by the vehicles and disposed products. We introduce a very practical innovative application of transshipment option to control transportation cost, reduce GHG emissions and absorb the uncertainty. In order to solve the proposed model an efficient hybrid algorithm combining L-shaped method (a sort of decomposition approach for stochastic optimization) and compromise programming (a well-known approach for multi-objective optimization) is proposed. The results show that how companies can make a reasonable tradeoff between the cost and environmental concerns and emphasize the role of transshipment option as a lever to improve both economic and environmental performance and absorb the demand fluctuations."
NABI Ghulam,Linan Fayolle Krueger WALMSLEY,01/06/2017,anglais,The impact of entrepreneurship education in higher education,"Using a teaching model framework, we systematically review empirical evidence on the impact of entrepreneurship education (EE) in higher education on a range of learning outcomes, analysing 159 published articles from 2004-2016. The teaching model framework allows us for the first time to start rigorously examining relationships between pedagogical methods and specific outcomes. Re-confirming past reviews and meta-analyses, we find that EE impact research still predominantly focuses on short-term and subjective outcome measures and tends to severely under-describe the actual pedagogies being tested. Moreover, we use our review to provide an up-to-date and empirically rooted call for less obvious, yet greatly promising, new or underemphasised directions for future research on the impact of university-based entrepreneurship education. This includes, for example, the use of novel impact indicators related to emotion and mindset, focus on the impact indicators related to the intention-to-behaviour transition, and explore the reasons for some of the contradictory findings in impact studies including person-, context- and pedagogical model-specific moderators."
CRAINICH David,EECKHOUDT Le Courtois,16/05/2017,anglais,Health and portfolio choices,"The effect of health status on portfolio decisions has been extensively studied from an empirical viewpoint. In this paper, we propose a theoretical model of individuals’ choice of financial assets under bivariate utility functions depending on wealth and health. Our approach makes an extensive use of the diffidence theorem. We establish the conditions under which the share of wealth held in risky assets falls as: 1) individuals’ health status deteriorates and; 2) individuals’ health status becomes risky. These conditions are shown to be related to the behaviour of the intensities of correlation aversion and of cross prudence as wealth increases."
Eib Constanze,Soenen,01/05/2017,anglais,Why Should Organizations Treat their Employees Fairly?,"This chapter explains why organizations should treat employees fairly and what happens when they do not. In the context of work and organizational psychology, organizational justice typically refers to the perceived fairness of an authority's decision-making. Authority figures like supervisors or managers, who are perceived as behaving fairly, are trusted, which, in turn, can affect performance positively. Conversely, employees who feel treated unfairly are more likely to exhibit behaviours that harm the organization or its members. In this chapter, we explore why justice is important for individuals in general and in the work context, under what circumstances someone is likely to feel fairly, or unfairly, treated, what the characteristics of a fair decision are and the rules managers have to abide by in order to be perceived as fair. Then, we review whether all people are equally impacted by the presence or absence of justice. Finally, we consider how fair organizations can be built."
Kornberger Martin,,01/05/2017,anglais,The visible hand and the crowd,"The effectiveness and creativity of Linux, Wikipedia, and a plethora of other distributed innovation systems have attracted the attention of scholars, practitioners, and policy makers. The hallmark of these distributed innovation systems is that value creation transcends the boundaries of hierarchically organized firms. To date, only relatively few studies have focused on the organization design of distributed innovation systems. This conceptual article addresses this lacuna by asking, how does organization design structure relationships in distributed innovation systems, including interactions between the “visible hand” of the manager and the “crowd” of distributed innovation? The purpose of this article is to shift the unit of analysis of organization design from the individual firm to networks of actors providing a framework to study how design organizes distributed innovation systems. In order to do so, three design mechanisms (interface design, the design of participatory architectures, and the design of evaluative infrastructures) are proposed through which firms and other network actors organize their encounter in “the open” and through which they manage communication, coordination of tasks, and control in distributed innovation systems."

In this paper, we develop a multi-objective mathematical framework for the IRP to link: (i) the economic performance, (ii) the achieved server level in terms of shortage and delivery delays and (iii) the environmental footprint. The framework developed addresses the uncertainty by considering fuzzy distributions for certain problem inputs, such as the demand and the transportation costs. We show the negative impact on the economic performance when service level targets are exogenously chosen without coordination with the logistics components (inventory and distribution)."
Rokka Joonas,,01/05/2017,anglais,Champagne: marketplace icon,"What makes a simple wine, grown in a rather mediocre wine-growing region, one of the most famous and magical marketplace icons of today? How did champagne establish such a unique position, against all the odds, and become the global symbol of celebration? In seeking answers to these questions, this marketplace icon contribution elaborates on what 250 years of avant-garde champagne marketing can tell us about champagne’s ever-shifting image and role in consumer culture. I argue that the “imperishable fame” of champagne stems primarily from four epic myth-making moments that not only came to shape a national identity but also modern consumption ideologies in important ways."
Arnould Eric John,Cayla Dion,01/04/2017,anglais,"Fetish, magic, marketing",This article identifies specific forms of fetishistic enchantments produced by practices culturally specific to modern consumer culture. The authors show that magical practices are constitutive of two fetishistic marketing constructs: the consumer and the human luxury brand. Marketing magic enacts relations between man and the transcendent by bringing consumer personas ‘to life’ and manifesting ideals of the beautiful in luxury. Marketing magic is a practice of power – non-rationalist strategies for resolving intractable social problems. Consumer ‘personas’ create the manageable consumer interlocutors for companies. Charismatic creative directors seem to evade the iron logic of commodity relationships via the magical conjuring of their own personas and of artful luxury.
Brigui-Chtioui Imène,Caillou,01/04/2017,anglais,Multidimensional Decision Model for Classifying Learners!!,"A new era of learning is arising, due to the development of the digital world and the maturity of web technologies. Massive open online courses (MOOCs) have emerged in this context and are challenging classical learning in spite of boundaries of time and space. They aim to provide good-quality education to masses that cannot be part of traditional university and school learning processes. This emancipation is coupled with a large amount of data collection via learning platforms. These data constitute a great opportunity to study interactions and to profit from this, in order to optimise learning and knowledge transfer. The challenge in creating value is how to represent, analyse and reuse data in order to characterise learners and so lead to better knowledge transfer. We focus, in this article, on the context of MOOC platforms based on Open edX (The leading online courses platform, initially developed by MIT and Harvard). The purpose of this paper is to propose a decision model that takes advantage of the different data-sets available on the learning platform in order to classify learners based on their behaviour and expertise. To this end, we propose a multi-agent approach that represents human actors using intelligent agents. A coordinator agent implements the multi-criteria decision model in order to optimise the learning process. This agent employs clustering algorithms and has an overview of the learning platform that enables it to assist learners and to learn from experiences and about other agents’ behaviour."
Soenen Guillaume,Melkonian Ambrose,01/04/2017,anglais,To Shift or Not to Shift?,"Building on fairness heuristic theory and dual-process theories of cognition, we examine individuals' perceptions of phase-shifting. We define phase-shifting as an individual perception that triggers a shift from type 1 to type 2 cognitive processes resulting in the reevaluation of justice judgments. In a longitudinal study of a merger, we empirically test the influence of phase-shifting perceptions on justice judgments, and we identify antecedents of phase-shifting perceptions. We find employees' perceptions of the change as a phase-shifting event moderates the relationship between overall justice judgments prior to change (time 1), and subsequent assessments of justice 6 months later (time 2). We study three situational antecedents (i.e., magnitude of change, managerial exemplarity, and coworker support for change) and one individual antecedent (i.e., dispositional resistance to change) of phase-shifting perceptions. The four hypothesized antecedents together predict 75% of employees' perceptions of the merger as a phase-shifting event. Implications for research and practice regarding organizational justice and organizational change are discussed."
Acosta Pilar,Perezts,25/03/2017,anglais,Unearthing Sedimentation Dynamics in Political CSR,"The stream on political corporate social responsibility (PCSR) argues that companies have recently assumed state-like roles to influence global governance. However, following emerging calls for greater contextualization of CSR, we trace the historic evolution of PCSR in the case of Colombia and argue that such political engagement by firms is not new. Looking beyond a linear chronological account, we reveal the sedimentation process behind PCSR by exploring the archetypical political roles businesses have taken on in providing public goods and acting as regulators, and chart their transformation. Our findings allow us to make two main contributions. First, by unearthing different strata of business and society relations, we enrich the research on PCSR, highlighting its historical sedimentation dynamics. By integrating institutional and historical perspectives, we respond to calls for complementary accounts of one of the premises found in the literature that considers globalization as the starting point of PCSR. Second, our exploration of the past and present of PCSR in Colombia provides scholars and practitioners with an overview of the complex state and stakes of CSR in that country. We also discuss the implications of sedimentation for PCSR theory and future research directions."
Grover Steven L.,Abid-Dupont Manville Hasel,24/03/2017,anglais,Repairing Broken Trust Between Leaders and Followers,"This study examines the conditions under which apologies help to elicit forgiveness and restore trust following trust violations between leaders and followers. The intentionality and severity of violations are examined in a critical incident study and a laboratory study. The results support a model in which forgiveness mediates the relation of apology quality and trust. More importantly, the moderation–mediation model shows that apology quality influenced forgiveness and subsequent trust following violations that were moderate in severity–intentionality combination. The effect of apologizing affects trust directly without forgiveness when the severity–intentionality combination held minor or extreme intensity. The results suggest a range in which apologies are effective and enrich understanding of the conditions under which trust can be recovered through an apology–forgiveness process in leader–follower relationships. The contribution of the study lies in elucidating that the combination of severity and intentionality of leaders’ trust violations has greater importance than either one separately."

Thus, entrepreneurship has been attracting increasing attention as a field of study. In this article, we aim to shed more light on the concept of entrepreneurship by presenting ongoing academic efforts to understand the phenomenon. As this is a complex topic with many possible angles, we chose to focus more particularly on the psychological and cognitive dimensions of entrepreneurship."
Courpasson David,,02/03/2017,anglais,Management as a Practice of Power,"This chapter emphasizes the centrality of power to management and organization. Management is a practice of power, framing management as a form of government whereby the conduct of individuals can be influenced and people can create arrangements permitting the distribution of work and responsibilities. It is also a capacity to construct infrastructures of power within which people can accomplish their tasks. Moreover, it is a practice of debate and deliberation around the means, ends and meanings of the workplace. On this basis, the chapter strives to highlight and illustrate the interrelations between management as power and some historical infrastructures within which power is concretely exercised. More specifically, it addresses the fundamental tension between centres and peripheries, suggesting that managing power is mostly about regulating the balance between the autonomy of local actors and the necessities of respecting central rules of operation."
Bommier Antoine,BRETSCHGER Le Grand,01/03/2017,anglais,Existence of equilibria in exhaustible resource markets with economies of scale and inventories,"The paper proves the existence of equilibrium in non-renewable resource markets when extraction costs are non-convex and resource storage is possible. Inventories flatten the consumption path and eliminate price jumps at the end of the extraction period, so that market equilibrium becomes possible. We distinguish between two types of solutions, one with immediate and one with delayed buildup of inventories. For both cases, we do not only characterize potential optimal paths but also show that equilibria actually exist under fairly general conditions. It is found that optimum resource extraction involves increasing quantities over a period of time. What is generally interpreted as an indicator of increasing resource abundance is thus perfectly compatible with constant resource stocks."

Dattée Brice,BARLOW,01/03/2017,anglais,Multilevel organizational adaptation,"We use the case of a “whole-system” change program in a national healthcare system to empirically examine the multilevel dynamics underlying organizational adaptation. Our analysis demonstrates how the cognitive distance between agents’ causal representations affects opportunities to cooperate in hierarchical systems. Using complexity theory, we identify a scale-invariant causal pathway that can be applied recursively across many organizational levels. At each level, three coupled feedback loops determine how local agents modify their cognitive representations to include uncovered interdependencies and synchronize their adaptive search across organizational boundaries: a “boundary work” loop, a “small wins” loop, and a “parochialism” loop. Our results also point to the scale-dependency of the strength of dissipative processes across levels. These novel results further develop the theory of organizational change and have practical implications for large multilevel organizations, especially regarding the sustainability of improvements."
Kelani Abdou,Quittard-Pinon,01/03/2017,anglais,Pricing and Hedging Variable Annuities in a Lévy Market,"Pricing and hedging life insurance contracts with minimum guarantees are major areas of concern for insurers and researchers. In this article, we propose a unified framework for pricing, hedging, and assessing the risk embedded in the guarantees offered by Variable Annuities in a Lévy market. We address these questions from a risk management perspective. This method proves to be fast, accurate, and efficient. For hedging, we use a local risk minimization to provide a concise formula for the optimal hedging ratio. We also consider hedging strategies that use a portfolio of standard options. For assessing risk, we introduce an accumulated discounted loss function that takes mortality, transaction costs, and fees into account. We apply our resulting unified framework to the Minimum Guarantees for Maturity Benefit, Death Benefit, and Accumulation Benefit contracts. We illustrate the whole method with CGMY and Kou processes, which prove to offer a realistic modeling for financial prices. From this application, we draw important practical implications. In particular, we show that the assumption of geometric Brownian motion leads to undervalue the actual economic capital necessary to hedge and gives an illusion of safety."
KOCH Michael,Forgues Monties,01/03/2017,anglais,The Way to the Top,"How have the CEOs of Fortune 100 companies worked their way to the top position? Are there several paths to the top, or have most present-day CEOs moved up the ranks in a similar fashion? We examine the employment trajectories of all of the current Fortune 100 CEOs across their entire working careers to answer these questions. The analysis developed in this article is carried out in two steps. We first use sequence analysis to find the patterns that are characteristic of the career paths of these CEOs. We then apply clustering techniques to identify distinct groups of career paths that have led individuals to the uppermost management level. Our results show that the careers of the Fortune 100 CEOs have largely followed traditional career paths that are symbolized by steady progression toward more responsibility, little mobility between firms and industries, and a strong focus on general management functions."
Nekhili Mehdi,Nagati Chtioui Nekhili,01/03/2017,anglais,Gender-diverse board and the relevance of voluntary CSR reporting,"In this paper, we focus on voluntary corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure, and we test the extent to which the value relevance of CSR reporting is affected by the appointment of female directors. Using a sample of French listed companies belonging to the SBF 120 index from 2001 to 2011, we control for differences in firm characteristics between firms with and without female board membership by using propensity score matching. Our results show that high CSR reporting is more relevant in terms of market value for firms with gender-diverse boards than for firms with completely male directors. This finding holds when we use the accounting-based performance measures, namely, return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). We also highlight that engaging an external assurance provider for CSR reporting is value relevant for firms without female directors but not value relevant for firms with female directors, suggesting a substitute relationship between gender-diverse boards and CSR assurance. Our results are stable when we consider the presence of at least two and three female directors."
Wu Xianhua,Chen Guo Wang Gong,01/03/2017,anglais,"Spatial concentration, impact factors and prevention-control measures of PM2.5 pollution in China","To improve the air pollution of China fundamentally, effective measures should be proposed based on the thorough understanding of the characteristics of air pollution. Based on spatial econometrics, this paper investigates the characteristics and analyzes the determinants of the spatial concentration of PM2.5 pollution in China. Results show that: (1) PM2.5 pollution is highly concentrated in Central and Eastern China, covering 17 regions which accounts for 75% of the total population and GDP (gross domestic product). (2) The PM2.5 values in China show a significant spatial correlation. Provinces such as Shandong, Henan, Anhui, and Hubei are high in PM2.5 concentration. Meanwhile, these provinces are high in population density, GDP, and coal consumptions and have a large amount of civilian cars. (3) PM2.5 pollution shows spatial spillover effects. A 1% increase in the PM2.5 values of neighboring provinces will lead to a 0.78% increase in that of one province. (4) An upward U-shaped relationship is observed between the density of per capita GDP and PM2.5, and the PM2.5 value is far from the turning point of growth. With the further growth of the density of per capita GDP, the PM2.5 value is expected to increase rapidly and continuously. (5) Based on the characteristics of spatial concentration and spatial spillover, this paper proposes several prevention-control measures for haze pollution, such as stressing on the treatment of air pollution in severely polluted provinces, avoiding moving pollution industries to neighboring areas, performing joint prevention and control nationwide. Air pollution may only be rooted by transforming the pattern of economic growth."
Brigui-Chtioui Imène,Caillou Negre,24/02/2017,anglais,Intelligent Digital Learning,"In the context of intelligent digital learning, we propose an agent-based recommender system that aims to help learners overcome their gaps by suggesting relevant learning resources. The main idea is to provide them with appropriate support in order to make their learning experience more effective. To this end we design an agent-based cooperative system where autonomous agents are able to update recommendation data and to improve the recommender outcome on behalf of their past experiences in the learning platform."
Santos Susana C.,Caetano Mitchell Landström Fayolle,24/02/2017,anglais,The Emergence of Entrepreneurial Behaviour,"In recent years entrepreneurship has become one of the most popular fields of research in management studies. As the subject has broadened, increasing attention has been paid to the behavioural aspects of different practices to identify and pursue entrepreneurial opportunities. This timely book analyses three key strands of contemporary research into entrepreneurial behaviour: intention, education and orientation. It offers novel insights that can be applied to foster entrepreneurial activities in different settings."
Capraro Valerio,Corgnet Espin Hernán-González,01/02/2017,anglais,Deliberation favours social efficiency by making people disregard their relative shares,"Groups make decisions on both the production and the distribution of resources. These decisions typically involve a tension between increasing the total level of group resources (i.e. social efficiency) and distributing these resources among group members (i.e. individuals' relative shares). This is the case because the redistribution process may destroy part of the resources, thus resulting in socially inefficient allocations. Here we apply a dual-process approach to understand the cognitive underpinnings of this fundamental tension. We conducted a set of experiments to examine the extent to which different allocation decisions respond to intuition or deliberation. In a newly developed approach, we assess intuition and deliberation at both the trait level (using the Cognitive Reflection Test, henceforth CRT) and the state level (through the experimental manipulation of response times). To test for robustness, experiments were conducted in two countries: the USA and India. Despite absolute-level differences across countries, in both locations we show that: (i) time pressure and low CRT scores are associated with individuals' concerns for their relative shares and (ii) time delay and high CRT scores are associated with individuals' concerns for social efficiency. These findings demonstrate that deliberation favours social efficiency by overriding individuals' intuitive tendency to focus on relative shares."
Courpasson David,Dany DELBRIDGE,01/02/2017,anglais,Politics of place,"The meaningfulness of the physical place within which resistance is nurtured and enacted has not been carefully considered in research on space and organizations. In this article, we offer two stories of middle managers developing resistance to managerial policies and decisions. We show that the appropriation and reconstruction of specific places by middle managers helps them to build autonomous resisting work thanks to the meanings that resisters attribute to the place in which they undertake resistance. We contribute to the literature on space and organizations by showing that resistance is a social experience through which individuals shape physical places and exploit the geographical blurring of organizations to develop political efforts that can be consequential. We also suggest the central role played by middle managers in the subversion of these meaningful places of resistance."
Fernandez Pablo,Marti Farchi,01/02/2017,anglais,Mundane and Everyday Politics for and from the Neighborhood,"Social movement scholars and activists have recognized the difficulties of mobilizing people for the long haul, moving from the exuberance of the protest to the dull and ordinary work necessary to produce sustainable change. Drawing on ethnographic work in La Juanita, in Greater Buenos Aires, we look at local actions for and from the neighborhood in order to resist political domination, taken by people who have been unemployed for long periods of time. We identified concrete and local practices and interventions—which we call mundane and everyday politics – that are embedded in a territory and go beyond the typical practices of social movements and the expected infrapolitical activity in allowing the disfranchised to engage in the political process."
Gao Peiran,Gong Zhang Mao Liu,01/02/2017,anglais,How CEO support of IT moderates the effectiveness of IT infrastructure and human resources in the IT assimilation process,"While previous studies have examined the effectiveness of IT resources in the IT assimilation process, CEO support of IT has not been integrated into. We thereby investigate the IT assimilation process by explaining how CEO support of IT moderates the relationship between IT resources and IT business spanning capability (ITBSC). Based on a multi-industry survey, we empirically show CEO support differentially moderates the impact of IT infrastructure and human resources, highlight CEO support can substitute the positive effects of IT infrastructure resources, and demonstrate that IT infrastructure has a positive effect on ITBSC only under low levels of CEO support."
Kornberger Martin,Meyer Brandtner Höllerer,01/02/2017,anglais,When Bureaucracy Meets the Crowd,"Open Government is en vogue, yet vague: while practitioners, policy-makers, and others praise its virtues, little is known about how Open Government relates to bureaucratic organization. This paper presents insights from a qualitative investigation into the City of Vienna, Austria. It demonstrates how the encounter between the city administration and “the open” juxtaposes the decentralizing principles of the crowd, such as transparency, participation, and distributed cognition, with the centralizing principles of bureaucracy, such as secrecy, expert knowledge, written files, and rules. The paper explores how this theoretical conundrum is played out and how senior city managers perceive Open Government in relation to the bureaucratic nature of their administration. The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to empirically trace the complexities of the encounter between bureaucracy and Open Government; and second, to critically theorize the ongoing rationalization of public administration in spite of constant challenges to its bureaucratic principles. In so doing, the paper advances our understanding of modern bureaucratic organizations under the condition of increased openness, transparency, and interaction with their environments."
Pagani Margherita,Malacarne,01/02/2017,anglais,Experiential engagement and active vs. passive behavior in mobile location-based social networks,The study aims to understand how social media and mobile change customer experiences and influence the online active behavior. We explore how leveraging differently on experiences that the users live online helps to increase experiential engagement and mitigate the negative influence of privacy concern on the active use of location-based social networking applications. We conceptualize experiential engagement as a second-order construct that is manifested in two first-order “experience” constructs (Personal Engagement and Social Interactive Engagement). We theorize that our engagement constructs are causally related to consumer active and passive use of a mobile location-based social network and we test (n=379) the moderating role of privacy concern on this relation in EU and US. Findings show that Personal Engagement plays an important role influencing active usage when users are more concerned with privacy issues. Social Interactive Engagement shows a significant effect on passive usage meaning that the more people experience a deep sense of community the more they are interested in reading other comments or collecting information. Managerial implications are discussed
Wassmer Ulrich,LI MADHOK,01/02/2017,anglais,Resource ambidexterity through alliance portfolios and firm performance,"Research Summary Partner resources can be an important alternative to internal firm resources for attaining dual and seemingly incompatible strategic objectives. We extend arguments about managing conflicting objectives typically made at the firm level to the level of a firm's alliance portfolio. Specifically, will a balance between revenue enhancement and cost reduction attained collectively through partner resources accessed via a firm's various alliances be similarly beneficial for firm performance? Additionally, how do strategic attributes of alliance portfolio configuration, specifically alliance portfolio size and partner resource scope, condition the balance-performance relationship? Based on data from the global airline industry, we find support for the balance – performance relationship, though such balance is less beneficial for firms in the case of access to a broader resource scope per partner. Managerial Summary Increasing revenue and reducing costs simultaneously can potentially enhance firm competitiveness. We highlight that an alliance strategy can be an important alternative to internal resources for attaining such dual strategic objectives, particularly when partner resources accessed through alliances are treated collectively as portfolios. We examine the importance of balancing product-market extending and efficiency-improving partner resources in the global airline industry, as well as the impact of two alternate strategies for accessing resources through alliances: fewer partners with more resources per partner or more partners with fewer resources per partner. We find that resource balance at the portfolio level helps airlines improve performance. Our results also suggest that managers should be cautious of accessing too many resources through just a few partners."

The RMFS can increase productivity, reduce costs, increase order picking accuracy, and improve operational flexibility. We build queue network models to describe the RMFS with two protocols in sharing robots for pickers, propose the corresponding algorithms, conduct numerical analyses, and evaluate the performance of the RMFS by calculating the throughput time. We then calculate the optimal number and the velocity of robots, and provide the effective design rules for the RMFS."
Courpasson David,Monties,01/01/2017,anglais,“I Am My Body”. Physical Selves of Police Officers in a Changing Institution,"Most studies on identity work have overlooked the corporeal quality of occupational life. Despite calls to attempt such engagement, little is known about the role of the body in occupations for which corporeal elements are central in the affirmation of identity. This study aims to answer such calls by providing a detailed ethnography of police work. Focusing on four bodily practices, we demonstrate how fitness, intimidation, cleanliness, and toughness are central elements to the officers’ construction of self. We thereby highlight the notion of physical selfhood as a way to understand the body/identity nexus among police officers and their capacity to resist new work requirements. We view bodies through a lens of resistance, rather than docility and compliance as much previous research has done. We aim to contribute to scholarship on identity work by portraying the politicization of bodies as a powerful component, thereby helping professionals to deflect some important institutional pressures affecting their work."
Ferreira João J. M.,Fayolle Fernandes Raposo,01/01/2017,anglais,Effects of Schumpeterian and Kirznerian entrepreneurship on economic growth,"The relevant literature recognises Schumpeterian and Kirznerian entrepreneurship as mechanisms that can impact economic growth. This article seeks to explore the effects of these two types of entrepreneurship on economic growth across the three GEM (Global Entrepreneurship Monitor) economic ecosystems (factor-driven economy, efficiency-driven economy, innovation-driven economy). Using different databases, we applied unbalanced panel data for 43 countries (2009–2013). By estimating the econometric models, we were able to calculate the effects of these two types of entrepreneurship on economic growth in the three different types of economy. In terms of the overall model for GEM economies, neither Schumpeterian nor Kirznerian entrepreneurship return any statistically significant effects on the Global Competitiveness Index or on GDP growth. However, the Total Early-Stage Entrepreneurial Activity variable generates a positive effect on the Global Competitiveness Index. The results presented in this paper provide insights into entrepreneurship and the GEM entrepreneurial economic ecosystems."

Postmerger integration plays a critical role in M&A success, yet many questions about M&A implementation remain unanswered. In this article, we review research on postmerger integration, which we organize around strategic integration, sociocultural integration, and experience and learning. We then lay out a research agenda that centers on expanding our understanding of processual dynamics in postmerger integration. We focus on opportunities related to temporality, decision-making, practices and tools, and emotionality."
Loi Michela,Castriotta Barbosa Di Guardo Fayolle Linan,01/01/2017,anglais,Modes of Thought in Entrepreneurial Intention Studies,"The concept of collective intelligence supports the notion that the coexistence of different perspectives is a necessary condition for a complex system to adapt to the environment and to keep its vitality. Transposing this assumption to a scientific community, we investigate the field of entrepreneurial intention studies and examine its internal dynamics by identifying the relevant practices to conduct research. Specifically, we conduct a hybrid bibliometric analysis to discover 68 articles constituting the field’s knowledge base and 83 articles representing its research fronts. This analysis is completed by an analytical coding of each paper according to the collective intelligence framework proposed by Woolley and Fuchs (2011). We find both a convergent and a divergent perspective; the former oriented to clarifying and bounding concepts, theories, and contexts; the latter interested in opening new paths. However, a reflective perspective that calls into question the field’s assumptions to reformulate directions and general purposes is still lacking. Our results suggest a set of priorities to be taken into account in the interest of driving future research."
Toutain Olivier,Fayolle,01/01/2017,anglais,Labour Market Uncertainty and Career Perspectives,"Nowadays entrepreneurship is high on the agenda of many countries, and the number of entrepreneurship education initiatives is growing fast. Since the beginning of the third millennium, European Union institutions (European Commission 2003, 2009, 2010, 2013), OECD (2010) and national governments across the European Union have become increasingly involved in entrepreneurship education. The various schemes and initiatives address primarily two broad objectives, on the one hand, supporting new business start-ups and, on the other hand, developing an entrepreneurial mindset in society (and among the young in particular). For example, an international survey conducted by the European Commission shows that 87% of European higher education institutions and universities offer entrepreneurship education programmes (European Commission 2008a)."
Wassmer Ulrich,Pain Paquin,01/01/2017,anglais,Taking environmental partnerships seriously,"Increasingly, firms are integrating environmental sustainability into their business strategies. Yet, sustainability is a complex topic and many firms need to form environmental partnerships to access additional resources—in the form of investments, technologies, expertise, public image, and/or political influence—to develop competitive advantage. Environmental partnership decisions are difficult, however, because they often need to reconcile multifaceted sustainability issues with multi-level, and potentially divergent, strategic goals. To meet their intended objectives, companies should carefully consider the type of environmental partnerships and partners that can best meet their needs. Based on a review of the literature, interviews with executives responsible for environmental partnerships, and publicly available data, we find firms engage in three main types of environmental partnerships: innovation-seeking, legitimacy-building, and policy-influencing. Each type of partnership benefits from different types of resources and partner choices. Herein, we describe the advantages of each type of environmental partnership and partners that may best support them. Given that many firms develop environmental partnership portfolios, managing multiple environmental partnerships simultaneously, we also discuss the implications of our research for environmental partnership portfolios."
XU Haoxuan,Gong CHU Zhang,01/01/2017,anglais,Dynamic Lot-Sizing Models for Retailers with Online Channels,"This paper studies inventory replenishment planning problems for retailers with online channels. Such retailer is able to obtain advance demand information (ADI) in an environment of time-varying demands. We incorporate ADI into dynamic lot-sizing models to formulate the replenishment planning problems for retailers in three scenarios: (1) companies act as pure-play online retailers with customers homogeneous in demand lead time, (2) online customers are heterogeneous in demand lead time with priorities, and (3) retailers operate in a bricks and clicks structure, in which demands come from online and offline channels, with either independent or interactive channels. We formulate the problem in the general scenario of interactive demand channels as a mixed-integer linear programming model, and then develop a unified model through reformulation. Based on the optimality properties, we design a dynamic programming algorithm with polynomial running time to solve the unified model. The numerical experiments for several online retailers find that the method can significantly reduce the total inventory cost."
André Eric,,01/12/2016,anglais,Crisp monetary acts in multiple-priors models of decision under ambiguity,"In axiomatic models of decision under ambiguity using a set of priors, a clear distinction can be made between acts which are affected by ambiguity and those which are not: the crisp acts. In these multiple-priors models, the decision maker is indifferent between holding a constant act or holding a non constant crisp act with the same expected utility, if it exists. In financial settings, we show that this indifference, together with the standard definition of monetary acts in the Anscombe–Aumann framework, implies that the investor ignores the variance of some assets, a behavior which conflicts with the assumption on which modern portfolio theory has been built. In this paper we establish the geometrical and topological properties of the set of priors that rule out the existence of non constant crisp acts. These properties in turn restrict what can possibly be an unambiguous financial asset."
Godey Bruno,Manthiou Pederzoli Rokka Aiello Donvito Singh,01/12/2016,anglais,Social media marketing efforts of luxury brands,"Scant evidence is available on of how social media marketing activities influence brand equity creation and consumers' behavior towards a brand. This research explores these relationships by analyzing pioneering brands in the luxury sector (Burberry, Dior, Gucci, Hermès, and Louis Vuitton). Based on a survey of 845 luxury brand consumers (Chinese, French, Indian, and Italian), who follow the five brands studied on social media, the study develops a structural equation model that helps to address gaps in prior social media branding literature. Specifically, the study demonstrates the links between social media marketing efforts and their consequences (brand preference, price premium, and loyalty). The study measures brands' social media marketing efforts as a holistic concept that incorporates five aspects (entertainment, interaction, trendiness, customization, and word of mouth). Another contribution of the study is that it finds that SMMEs have a significant positive effect on brand equity and on the two main dimensions of brand equity: brand awareness and brand image."
Groh Alexander,Wallmeroth,01/12/2016,anglais,Determinants of venture capital investments in emerging markets,"Jeng and Wells (2000) initialized the examination of venture capital (VC) determinants across countries. Meanwhile, we enlarge their scope using aggregated VC funding in 118 countries, 78 being considered emerging markets, using panel data from 2000 to 2013. We show that M&A activity, legal rights and investor protection, innovation, IP protection, corruption and also corporate taxes and unemployment have impact. We reveal the economic magnitude and direction of impact of the determinants to be different for the two country categories for several parameters, enhancing previous research by emphasizing that VC investment drivers can be different for developed and developing countries."
Nigam Amit,Huising Golden,01/12/2016,anglais,Explaining the Selection of Routines for Change during Organizational Search,"We examine how organizations select some routines to be changed, but not others, during organizational search. Selection is a critical step that links an exogenous trigger for change, change in individual routines, and larger processes of organizational adaptation. Drawing on participant observation of an initiative to improve perioperative efficiency in seven Ontario hospitals, we find that organizational roles shape selection by influencing both politics and frames in organizational search. Roles shape politics by defining the role-specific goals of the people who have authority to change a routine. Organizations will not select a routine for change unless at least some elites—people with role-based authority—frame the existing routine as negatively affecting their role-specific goals. Roles also shape individuals’ frames. Because people are only partially exposed to interdependencies between routines in their day-to-day work, they may not be fully aware of the diverse impact that an existing routine can have on their goals. Proponents for change can use strategic framing to focus attention on interdependencies between routines to get elites to better see how an existing routine negatively affects their goals. They can also change elites’ goals by using strategic framing to focus attention on new and broader goals that the change in routine would promote."
Smith Celina,,01/12/2016,anglais,Environmental Jolts,"Environmental jolts are dramatic unexpected events that can seriously affect firm outcomes, yet little is known about how family firms may respond. Research indicates that they will seek to preserve their socioemotional wealth endowments when these are threatened; less clear is how or why they may differ in this process. Drawing on the same environmental jolt this study investigates their behavioral response. It finds they engage to different extents in behavior labeled as engagement intensification, which engenders increasing risk for their business. While there are differences in family firms’ socioemotional wealth these do not sufficiently explain differences in their behavioral response."
Seidemann Vera,Atwal Heine,24/11/2016,anglais,Gift culture in China,"In the Peoples’ Republic of China, gift-giving is “materialized communication” with luxury products as a major category of gifts. Western luxury brands including fine wines are popular among Chinese consumers. They are used as symbols of wealth and power, which help to maintain and improve one’s “Face”. However, due to several high-profile corruption scandals within the communist party, the Chinese government enacted new regulations to curb gift-giving as part of a campaign against corruption. The consequences have been significant within the fine wine sector. Recent industry data suggests a decrease in sales of fine wines in China. Following these developments, the chapter aims to provide an understanding of the Chinese gift-giving culture and discuss implications within the fine wine sector."
Betancourt Nathan,Wezel,01/11/2016,anglais,The Credibility of Social Climbing,"This paper examines when inter-firm mobility influences organizational status. Whereas a low-status firm can accumulate prestigious affiliations by hiring from a high-status firm, the status distance between these firms may influence whether the mobility event is perceived as credible. If the mobility event lacks credibility, meaning that market participants believe that the employee moved for a reason other than the new employer’s quality, then the hiring firm is less likely to improve its status position. We also explore this effect’s symmetry and find that a high-status firm is less likely to experience status decline when the mobility event lacks credibility. We assess these hypotheses in the context of the inter-firm mobility of partners of the subsidiary offices of international law firms in Hong Kong from 1998 to 2008."

Floryszczak Anthony,Le Courtois Majri,01/11/2016,anglais,Inside the Solvency 2 Black Box,"The calculation of Net Asset Values and Solvency Capital Requirements in a Solvency 2 context–and the derivation of sensitivity analyses with respect to the main financial and actuarial risk drivers–is a complex procedure at the level of a real company, where it is illusory to be able to rely on closed-form formulas. The most general approach to performing these computations is that of nested simulations. However, this method is also hardly realistic because of its huge computation resources demand. The least-squares Monte Carlo method has recently been suggested as a way to overcome these difficulties. The present paper confirms that using this method is indeed relevant for Solvency 2 computations at the level of a company."
Le Courtois Olivier,Walter,01/11/2016,anglais,Lévy Processes and Extreme Value Theory,"There are fundamentally two different ways of viewing the uncertainty of financial asset prices in continuous time. The first assumes the principle of continuity, the second does not. This chapter develops the relationships connecting the Levy processes and extreme value theory (EVT). It begins by defining the modeling alternative and the challenges contemporary finance has to tackle. Next, the chapter presents the link with EVT. It talks about the main definitions of the EVT framework. Then, it moves to a presentation of Lévy processes and studies stable Lévy processes. The chapter examines two subclasses of semi-heavy-tailed Lévy processes that are based on tempered stable and generalized hyperbolic distributions. Finally, the chapter deals with the relationships between Lévy processes and extreme value distributions. It also studies the Fisher-Tippett theorem, Generalized Jenkinson-von Mises distribution, and maximum domains of attraction."
Titah Ryad,SHURAIDA Rekik,01/11/2016,anglais,Integration Breach,"The net benefit effects of information integration on organizational performance have rarely been challenged in the literature. While some empirical studies have provided support for the positive effects of information integration, very few have suggested that firms may be “worse off’ as a result of it. In line with the latter view, this study considers that information integration could have either positive or negative impacts depending on the congruence or lack thereof of the objectives between the entities involved in information integration. To investigate this view, this study examines the effect of different types of information integrations on firm performance under supply and demand uncertainty. We consider a supply chain composed of two stages where a supplier provides a retailer with a single product under a periodic review multi-period framework. Internal Information Integration is reflected in joint dynamic pricing and ordering strategies by the retailer’s logistics and marketing units, with the objective of maximizing the expected profit under a customer service level target. External Information Integration is reflected in the supplier sharing his supply variation with the retailer, and in the retailer sharing his customer level target with the supplier. The study’s findings show that Full integration (i.e., centralized decision making) results in optimal firm profitability, inventory policy and customer service level when both the supplier and the retailer have shared objectives. In contrast, when the supplier and the retailer focus on maximizing their own performance, an “Arm’s length relationship”-i.e., No integration-becomes a better alternative than Full integration, thus indicating that high integration levels are not always beneficial to the firm."
Corgnet Brice,Espin Hernán-González,25/10/2016,anglais,Creativity and Cognitive Skills among Millennials,"Organizations crucially need the creative talent of millennials but are reluctant to hire them because of their supposed lack of diligence. Recent studies have shown that hiring diligent millennials requires selecting those who score high on the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) and thus rely on effortful thinking rather than intuition. A central question is to assess whether the push for recruiting diligent millennials using criteria such as cognitive reflection can ultimately hamper the recruitment of creative workers. To answer this question, we study the relationship between millennials' creativity and their performance on fluid intelligence (Raven) and cognitive reflection (CRT) tests. The good news for recruiters is that we report, in line with previous research, evidence of a positive relationship of fluid intelligence, and to a lesser extent cognitive reflection, with convergent creative thinking. In addition, we observe a positive effect of fluid intelligence on originality and elaboration measures of divergent creative thinking. The bad news for recruiters is the inverted U-shape relationship between cognitive reflection and fluency and flexibility measures of divergent creative thinking. This suggests that thinking too much may hinder important dimensions of creative thinking. Diligent and creative workers may thus be a rare find."
Colombo Massimo G.,Piva Quas Rossi Lamastra,01/10/2016,anglais,How high-tech entrepreneurial ventures cope with the global crisis,"The global crisis that began in the second half of 2008 abruptly changed the business context, inducing firms to react by modifying their strategies. This paper examines changes in innovation and internationalization strategies that high-tech entrepreneurial ventures implemented to react to the crisis. Relying on insights from the behavioural theory of the firm and threat-rigidity theory, we explore the antecedents of firms’ investments in development of new products and in expansion in international markets and the consequences of these changes on firms’ growth performance. Econometric results from a sample of 140 Italian high-tech entrepreneurial ventures support the view that the stock of resources accumulated by larger firms, firms’ innovation and internationalization investments in the pre-crisis period and firms’ cash flow determine the extent of the two changes. The effects of these changes on firms’ short-term growth performance are positive only for investments in development of new products."

KAM activities typically involve a firm-internal network of actors. While there is a rich body of literature on key account managers' work with external networks in customer firms, this study focusses on the much less explored KAM activities in interaction with the firm-internal network that is required to mobilise resources and develop activities towards key accounts. The purpose of this study is to develop a conceptual framework explaining how the firm's capability to manage the internal KAM network contributes to firm performance. We illustrate our framework using case study material and develop avenues for future research along the elements of our framework."
Vaara Eero,Lamberg,01/10/2016,anglais,Taking historical embeddedness seriously,"Despite the proliferation of strategy process and practice research, we lack understanding of the historical embeddedness of strategic processes and practices. In this paper, we present three historical approaches with the potential to remedy this deficiency. First, realist history can contribute to a better understanding of the historical embeddedness of strategic processes; in particular, comparative historical analysis can explicate the historical conditions, mechanisms, and causality in strategic processes. Second, interpretative history can add to our knowledge of the historical embeddedness of strategic practices, and microhistory can specifically help to understand the construction and enactment of these practices in historical contexts. Third, poststructuralist history can elucidate the historical embeddedness of strategic discourses, and genealogy can in particular increase our understanding of the evolution and transformation of strategic discourses and their power effects. Thus, this paper demonstrates how in their specific ways historical approaches and methods can add to our understanding of different forms and variations of strategic processes and practices, the historical construction of organizational strategies, and historically constituted strategic agency."
Zou Bipan,Xu Gong de Koster,01/10/2016,anglais,Modeling parallel movement of lifts and vehicles in tier-captive vehicle-based warehousing systems,"This paper models and analyzes tier-captive autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems. While previous models assume sequential commissioning of the lift and vehicles, we propose a parallel processing policy for the system, under which an arrival transaction can request the lift and the vehicle simultaneously. To investigate the performance of this policy, we formulate a fork-join queueing network in which an arrival transaction will be split into a horizontal movement task served by the vehicle and a vertical movement task served by the lift. We develop an approximation method based on decomposition of the fork-join queueing network to estimate the system performance. We build simulation models to validate the effectiveness of analytical models. The results show that the fork-join queueing network is accurate in estimating the system performance under the parallel processing policy. Numerical experiments and a real case are carried out to compare the system response time of retrieval transactions under parallel and sequential processing policies. The results show that, in systems with less than 10 tiers, the parallel processing policy outperforms the sequential processing policy by at least 5.51%. The advantage of parallel processing policy is decreasing with the rack height and the aisle length. In systems with more than 10 tiers and a length to height ratio larger than 7, we can find a critical retrieval transaction arrival rate, below which the parallel processing policy outperforms the sequential processing policy."
Rokka Joonas,Canniford,06/09/2016,anglais,Heterotopian selfies,"Purpose Digital technologies are changing the ways in which the meanings and identity of both consumers and brands are constructed. This research extends knowledge of how consumer-made “selfie” images shared in social media might contribute to the destabilization of brands as assemblages. Design/methodology/approach Insights are drawn from a critical visual content analysis of three popular champagne brand accounts and consumer-made selfies featuring these brands in Instagram. Findings Our study shows how brands and branded selves intersect through ‘heterotopian selfie practices’. Accentuated by the rise of attention economy and ‘consumer microcelebrity’, we argue that these proliferating selfie images can destabilise spatial, temporal, symbolic, and material properties of brand assemblages. Practical implications Implications include a consideration of how selfie practices engender new challenges for brand design and brand management. Originality/value Our study illustrates how a brand assemblage approach can guide investigations of brands at multiple scales of analysis. In particular, we extend knowledge of visual brand-related user-generated content in terms of how consumers express, visualise and share selfies and how the heterotopian quality of this sharing consequently shapes brand assemblages."
Birhanu Addis Gedefaw,Gambardella Valentini,01/09/2016,anglais,Bribery and Investment,"Research summary: Using a unique database that measures firm-level bribery in Africa and Latin America, we corroborate extant results in the literature that paying bribes deters firm investments in fixed assets. Our contribution is to explore four mechanisms. By adopting a reverse causality approach (Gelman and Imbens, 2013), we find evidence consistent with one of them: short-term oriented firms prefer to bribe rather than invest in fixed assets, while the opposite is true for firms with a long-term orientation. We rule out that bribe payments drain financial resources for investment, that firms that invest do not bribe because fixed assets make them less flexible and more vulnerable to future bribes, and that less efficient firms bribe rather than invest. Managerial summary: We ask whether, along with ethical issues, bribing affects the behavior and performance of firms in Africa and Latin America. Our statistical analysis shows that bribe payments do not reduce the short-term performance of firms, but frustrate investments in fixed assets, which is the foundation of firms' long-term growth. It is like seeking a job via nepotism or education. Nepotism makes it likely to find a job in the short term. However, the solid skills generated by education raise the odds of finding better jobs in the future. We rule out some common explanations for the trade-off between bribing and investment (e.g., bribes drain resources to invest or that less efficient firms bribe and do not invest). Our analysis suggests that firms with short-term orientations are more likely to bribe and firms with long-term orientation are more likely to invest."
Castaldo Sandro,Grosso Mallarini Rindone,01/09/2016,anglais,The Missing Path to Gain Customers Loyalty in Pharmacy Retail,"Background An evolution led to community pharmacies experiencing increased competition both between themselves and with new entrants in the sector, for example, grocery retailers. Applying certain retail marketing strategies aimed at developing store loyalty may be an appropriate strategic path for pharmacies wanting to compete in this new arena. Objectives This study aimed to develop and test a two-step model to identify the determinants of store loyalty for community pharmacies in Italy. Methods Based on the retail literature, qualitative research was conducted to identify key variables determining loyalty to community pharmacies. The model was then tested by means of a phone survey. A total of 735 usable questionnaires was collected. Results The study highlights the key role of the relationship between pharmacists and their customers in the loyalty-building path; trust in pharmacists is the first driver of satisfaction and a direct and indirect (through satisfaction) driver of trust in pharmacies, which leads to store loyalty. Retail-level levers, such as the store environment, assortment, and communication, influence trust in pharmacies. Conclusions This model is a first step towards investigating loyalty-building by applying the retail management literature’s concepts to the community pharmacy sector."
Coqueret Guillaume,Tavin,01/09/2016,anglais,An investigation of model risk in a market with jumps and stochastic volatility,"The aim of this paper is to investigate model risk aspects of variance swaps and forward-start options in a realistic market setup where the underlying asset price process exhibits stochastic volatility and jumps. We devise a general framework in order to provide evidence of the model uncertainty attached to variance swaps and forward-start options. In our study, both variance swaps and forward-start options can be valued by means of analytic methods. We measure model risk using a set of 21 models embedding various dynamics with both continuous and discontinuous sample paths. To conduct our empirical analysis, we work with two major equity indices (S&P 500 and Eurostoxx 50) under different market situations. Our results evaluate model risk between 50 and 200 basis points, with an average value slightly above 100 basis points of the contract notional."

These and other terms have become part of an emerging lexicon in recent years, signalling an important development that has gripped many parts of the world: millions of people are increasingly involved, whether directly or indirectly, in movements of resistance and protestation. However, resistance and its conceptual companions”, protest, contestation, opposition, disobedience and mobilization, all seem to be still mostly seen in public and private discourses as illegitimate and problematic forms of action. The time is, therefore, ripe to delve into the concerns, themes and legitimacy. The SAGE Handbook of Resistance offers theoretical essays enabling readers to forge their own perspectives of what “is” resistance and emphasizes the empirical and experiential dimension of resistance - making strong choices in terms of how contemporary topics related to resistance help to rethink our societies as “protest societies”.

Fabbri Julie,,01/09/2016,anglais,Unplugged - “Place as spatio-temporal events”,Sergot and Saives pointed out how Massey’s relational approach to the notions of space and place allows a better integration of the spatial and temporal dimensions of organizational phenomena. This paper shows empirically how activities are embedded in the organizational space as constituted and transformed through day-to-day activities. The increasing number of coworking spaces opening worldwide offers an interesting framework to discuss the meaning of space and the importance of physical co-localization for different businesses in the digital era and open innovation paradigm. We use a case study of a coworking space to show the intertwining of spatial and temporal dimensions in the everyday life of an inter-company workplace.

Melkonian Tessa,Soenen Ambrose,01/09/2016,anglais,Will I Cooperate?,"This study examines the influence of a dimension of a strategic organizational change context—namely informational distance—on employees’ justice expectations and their behavioral intentions toward the change. Drawing on research from organizational justice and from construal level theory, we hypothesize that informational distance, i.e., the extent to which employees feel knowledgeable about the coming change, affects the relative influence of the anticipatory justice facets and anticipatory overall justice in predicting support for change. Consistent with the hypotheses, results from participants of a merger suggest that when employees feel less knowledgeable about the future change (high-informational distance), overall anticipatory justice predicts their intention to cooperate with the change. However, when employees feel more knowledgeable about the future change (low-informational distance), anticipatory justice facets predict intention to cooperate. Implications for research on organizational justice and change as well as considerations for practice are discussed."

A significant number of SMEs had difficulties surviving after the 2007 economic crisis and during an intensive competition in the global market. The implementation of an intellectual capital (IC) system supported with stakeholder involvement contributes to the SMEs in long-term competitiveness development. In this work, we have implemented the IC system based on the process model and the Skandia navigator model. The proposed IC system is the integration of joint application development, business plan, and customer relationship management on three selected SMEs in Thailand emphasising on enhancing stakeholder involvement. The significant achievement in IC categories in human, financial, and customer prospects has been addressed."
Silberzahn Philippe,,30/08/2016,anglais,A Manager's guide to Disruptive Innovation,"Somewhere, a startup is at work disrupting your business. What can you do about it? How can your company avoid the fate of once highly successful firms such as Kodak or Blockbuster? This book unravels the mechanisms of disruption, explains why great companies fail, and proposes concrete ways to turn disruptions into opportunities. Its key message is this: Failure in the face of disruption is not due to a lack of creativity, limited resources, or a resistance to change. Failure is the unintended consequence of applying “good” management practices. The solution to success lies in modifying these practices and this book will tell you how. An ideal introduction to the topic, A Manager’s Guide to Disruptive Innovation is packed with interesting case studies and anecdotes of organizations faced with disruptive innovation. This book offers you: • A deep insight into the workings of disruptive innovation • Actionable steps to protect and nurture disruptive projects • Practical suggestions to transform your company’s management practices to become more innovative"
Arregle Jean-Luc,Miller Hitt Beamish,01/08/2016,anglais,How does Regional Institutional Complexity Affect MNE Internationalization?,"International business research is only beginning to develop theory and evidence highlighting the importance of supranational regional institutions to explain firm internationalization. In this context, we offer new theory and evidence regarding the effect of a region’s “institutional complexity” on foreign direct investment decisions by multinational enterprises (MNEs). We define a region’s institutional complexity using two components, regional institutional diversity and number of countries. We explore the unique relationships of both components with MNEs’ decisions to internationalize into countries within the region. Drawing on semiglobalization and regionalization research and institutional theory, we posit an inverted U-shaped relationship between a region’s institutional diversity and MNE internationalization: extremely low or high regional institutional diversity has negative effects on internationalization, but moderate diversity has a positive effect on internationalization. Larger numbers of countries within the region reduces MNE internationalization in a linear fashion. We find support for these predicted relationships in multilevel analyses of 698 Japanese MNEs operating in 49 countries within 9 regions. Regional institutional complexity is both a challenge and an opportunity for MNEs seeking advantages through the aggregation and arbitrage of individual country factors."

We report on the findings of an inductive case study of corporate entrepreneurship training in a large multinational corporation. We explore the learning outcomes which participants experienced, and outline how an action learning approach enabled these learning outcomes. Our emergent model of corporate entrepreneurship training is based on an episodic view of training, recognizing that individual, group and situational influences, need to be considered if a more complete understanding of what makes for effective training in this domain is to be developed."

Le Grand François,Ragot,01/08/2016,anglais,Incomplete markets and derivative assets,"We analyze derivative asset trading in an economy in which agents face both aggregate and uninsurable idiosyncratic risks. Insurance markets are incomplete for idiosyncratic risk and, possibly, for aggregate risk as well. However, agents can exchange insurance against aggregate risk through derivative assets such as options. We present a tractable framework, which allows us to characterize the extent of risk sharing in this environment. We show that incomplete insurance markets can explain some properties of the volume of traded derivative assets, which are difficult to explain in complete market economies."

We build on transaction costs and neo-institutional economics and use event history method and Vietnamese data on 3835 joint ventures and wholly owned subsidiaries established by foreign firms from 1987 to 2008 to answer this question. We find that survival rates for entry modes that are partially aligned to transactional and institutional factors differ for JV- and WOS-based entries. We provide new evidence for the predictive power of the transactional and institutional approach for entry mode choice, performance, and survival in transition economies."
Zollo Maurizio,Bettinazzi Neumann Snoeren,01/08/2016,anglais,Toward a Comprehensive Model of Organizational Evolution,"This article argues that the rapid evolution of expectations and influence capacity by corporate stakeholders requires managers in MNCs not only to adapt operating activities, but to rethink the purpose and overarching goal of the business enterprise, adapting it from a shareholder-primacy to a multi-stakeholder enterprise model. This complex adaptation process, however, requires the development of a specific form of competence to be developed and honed, different in kind from the typical capabilities focused on organizational change. With the help of concrete examples of sustainability-driven change initiatives, we discuss how the two enterprise models differ and how the development of this new type of competence facilitates the transition from one to the other."

Beyond the pros and cons of being open to innovate, we address the questions of how to open up inbound innovation processes and how to manage the partnership portfolio through time. To do so, we base ourselves on the OI and strategic alliance literature. We then conduct a qualitative survey in 18 global companies famous for their OI practices. We thus show that OI approaches are not always based on extensive openness of external partnerships, and that companies can choose among three OI strategies : topic-oriented OI, partner-oriented OI or fully open approaches, which are not mutually exclusive. We also emphasize that they face a trade-off between breadth and depth of partnerships, which evolves over time."
Gonthier-besacier Nathalie,Hottegindre Fine-Falcy,01/07/2016,anglais,Audit Quality Perception,"This paper measures differences in the perception of audit quality between professionals, and attempts to categorise the professionals on the basis of their perceptions. We firstly perform a REBUS-PLS analysis. We thus identify three groups of professionals with different audit quality perceptions. We then run chi-square tests to evaluate differences in perception depending firstly on the professional's role in the audit process (auditor vs. preparer) and then by incorporating other variables connected with the individuals’ own characteristics. Contrary to existing research, our study reveals no significant differences in perception between auditors and preparers. In contrast, our study indicates that differences in audit quality perception can be explained in particular by the professionals' level of expertise and the existence of shared values among professionals. This study therefore demonstrates the need to look beyond the ‘role-perception gap’ in order to understand differences in audit quality perception. It confirms the existence of an ‘epistemic community’ that explains the differences in audit quality perception."
Kalika Michel,Shenton Dubois,01/07/2016,anglais,What happens if a business school disappears?,"Purpose – The FNEGE and then EFMD have been interested in defining a methodology that would make it possible to highlight the impact of a business school on its home territory. This has led to the development of the “Business School Impact System” (BSIS), which is introduced in this paper. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is structured as follows. The authors first present the methodological issues of the work that led us to develop the “BSIS” (EFMD, 2014). In a second section, the authors present BSIS in more detail. Findings – Based on the exploratory interviews and the literature review, the authors could first identify three main categories of impact: the financial impact; the impact on the regional community; and the impact on attractiveness and image. Originality/value – The first benefit of BSIS is linked to the creation of an information system on impact. Second, the BSIS process increases the awareness inside the business school regarding the significance of this issue. Third, the authors observe that for numerous members of the business school the question of the impact of their activity gives them a better image of their job, of what they are doing and why they are doing it. Fourth, the BSIS report constitutes a powerful tool for communication with the stakeholders. The final benefit lies in the reviewers’ recommendations on how to improve the impact of the business school."
Leefmann Jon,Levallois Hildt,01/07/2016,anglais,Neuroethics 1995-2012. A bibliometric analysis of the guiding themes of an emerging research field,"In bioethics, the first decade of the twenty-first century was characterized by the emergence of interest in the ethical, legal and social aspects of neuroscience research. At the same time an ongoing extension of the topics and phenomena addressed by neuroscientists was observed alongside its rise as one of the leading disciplines in the biomedical science. One of these phenomena addressed by neuroscientists and moral psychologists was the neural processes involved in moral decision-making. Today both strands of research are often addressed under the label of neuroethics. To understand this development we recalled literature from 1995 to 2012 stored in the Mainz Neuroethics Database (i) to investigate the quantitative development of scientific publications in neuroethics; (ii) to explore changes in the topics of neuroethics research within the defined time intervall; (iii) to illustrate the interdependence of different research topics within the neuroethics literature; (iv) to show the development of the distribution of neuroethics research on peer-reviewed journals; and (v) to display the academic background and affiliations of neuroethics researchers. Our analysis exposes that there has been a demonstrative increase of neuroethics research while the issues addressed under this label had mostly been present before the establishment of the field. We show that the research on the ethical, legal and social aspects of neuroscience research is hardly related to neuroscience research on moral decision-making and that the academic backgrounds and affiliations of many neuroethics researchers speak for a very close entanglement of neuroscience and neuroethics. As our article suggests that after more than one decade there still is no dominant agenda for the future of neuroethics research, it calls for more reflection about the theoretical underpinnings and prospects to establish neuroethics as a marked-off research field distinct from neuroscience and the diverse branches of bioethics."
Marano Valentina,Arregle Hitt Spadafora Van Essen,01/07/2016,anglais,Home Country Institutions and the Internationalization-Performance Relationship,"We propose that the mixed findings of research on the internationalization-performance (I-P) relationship reflect its failure to adequately consider the derating role of firms’ home country formal and informal institutions. This general hypothesis is supported in a meta-analysis of the firm-, industry-, home country–, and host country–level factors driving the I-P relationship across 32 countries between 1972 and 2012 from 359 primary studies—the largest sample of primary studies of any meta-analysis on this topic to date. We make three main contributions to the I-P and global strategy literatures. First, we develop a novel integration of the theoretical logics from the I-P research and the institution-based view of strategy to explain how embeddedness in home country institutions affects the strength of the I-P relationship. Second, we show the importance of including both formal and informal institutions in analyses of firms’ institutional embeddedness, thereby extending our knowledge of the effects of institutional complexity. Our third contribution is methodological and reflects our use of advanced meta-analytical techniques based on both product-moment and partial correlations as effect sizes, which allow us to address unresolved debates about the sign and shape of the I-P relationship. Our results show that the I-P relationship is positive, although the overall effect is small and varies greatly across firms’ home countries. We conclude by discussing the findings’ relevance and promising future research avenues, including novel research questions, multilevel theoretical and empirical frameworks, and improvements in methodological rigor."
Montauti Martina,Wezel,01/07/2016,anglais,Charting the Territory,"In this paper, we conceptualize categories as regions of a cognitive map that structure the market and guide the investment decisions of potential entrants—i.e., of new and established organizations. We advance that, as a category appears altered via incumbents’ acts of recombination, potential entrants face market-specific uncertainty and are discouraged to invest in that category. These negative effects of recombination on market entries are, however, mitigated at increasing values of category status. We test our arguments in the market for electronic music. The analyses of product and organizational entries in music styles between 1978 and 2011 lend support to our arguments."
Xu Xianhao,Zou Shen Gong,01/07/2016,anglais,Travel-time models and fill-grade factor analysis for double-deep multi-aisle AS/RSs,"Double-deep multi-aisle automated storage/retrieval systems are increasingly applied for storing and retrieving unit loads, with advantages of increased space utilisation, reduced number of aisles and improved efficiency of storage rack (S/R) machines. In such systems, the retrieval process may consist of the rearrangement of blocking loads, based on the assumptions of uniformly distributed storage locations and random storage policy. We formulate analytical travel-time models of both single- and dual-command cycles under three rearrangement rules. We validate the analytical travel-time models by simulation and conduct numerical experiments to analyse the effect of the number of aisles an S/R machine serves, the fill-grade factor and the command cycles on the expected travel time of the S/R machine. The results show that the expected travel time of the S/R machine is increasing with the increase in the number of aisles an S/R machine serves and the increase in the fill-grade factor, and dual command cycle outperforms single-command cycle in terms of cycle time. To deal with the trade-off between the storage space cost and the operational cost of the S/R machine, we develop a decision model for finding an optimal fill-grade factor to minimise the total cost. We find the condition when an optimal fill-grade factor exists and show how to calculate it. Based on the decision model, we compare the performance of double-deep multi-aisle automated storage/retrieval system (AS/RSs) and single-deep single-aisle AS/RSs. The results show that double-deep multi-aisle AS/RSs outperform single-deep single-aisle AS/RSs in terms of total cost, although double-deep multi-aisle AS/RSs need more storage locations."

The warehouse operations manager needs to decide which storage orders to accept and schedule them across different storage units to maximize revenue. We model warehouse operations as scheduling n independent multiprocessor tasks with given start and end times, with an objective to maximize revenue. With operational constraints like the maximal upscaling level, precedence order constraints, and maximal idle time, the established mixed-integer program cannot be efficiently solved by commercial softwares. We therefore propose a column generation approach and a branch-and-price method to find an optimal schedule. Computational experiments show that, compared with current methods in self-storage warehouses, our method can significantly increase the revenue."

Predominantly, research on strategic decision-making has focused on CEOs as if they decide alone. Yet in reality, even the most powerful CEO makes strategic decisions together with an executive board. This chapter offers a theoretical explanation of strategic board decision-making through the emotional contagion between the CEO and board members. Methodology/approach We used both previous research and qualitative material – two case studies and interviews with several dozen CEOs of large corporations as well as the board members of one of them – to build our theoretical model. Findings Our inBoard Emotional Contagion Model (inBECM) specifies the following individual–collective emotional dynamics: After a strategic affective event has triggered an affective discussion within the boardroom, the emotionally intelligent CEO communicates verbally in order to – through an emotional contagion – homogenize board members’ emotional states leading to shared sense-making of the event and – potentially – to improved decision-making. Research/ Social/Practical implications Suggestions are made for the inBECM contribution to emotion theory. Implications are stated for the key role of emotion in improving board decision-making and strategizing."

Neubert Gilles,Lambey-Checchin,01/06/2016,anglais,The Sustainable value proposition of PSSs,"Product/Service Systems are conceived to be competitive, satisfy customer needs and have a lower environmental impact than traditional business models. Based on a single case study, this paper analyses the specific sustainable value proposition that a company has designed to replace a low-cost product by an innovative Product Service Solution. The objective of the company is to replace the “shower head” in every hospital room. The concept that was developed does not consist in replacing product “A” by an equivalent product “B”, but in changing radically the offer. The Product Service Solution includes a lifecycle analyses, by integrating environmental social and economic impacts into the different main phases, i.e. beginning of life (BOL), Middle-of-life (MOL) and End-of-life (EOL). Even though the product that was designed to support the service looks very simple, the design of this innovative solution highlights the role of the functional analyses to be more environmental friendly, to improve social issues and finally proposes a new business model based on servicisation. The “shower head” as a service developed by ECOBEL is far beyond the low-cost product used today in the French hospital, by integrating a new sustainable value proposition."

Using Schein's conceptualization of culture (i.e., underlying assumptions, espoused values, and artifacts), we build and test a model among five variables: top management commitment to safety (MCS), group level product safety culture (PSC) at NPD, Concurrent Engineering (CE), Design-for-Safety (DFS), and product safety performance. We propose that the underlying assumption of safety first affects the espoused values (group level product safety culture at NPD) and artifacts of organizational culture (Concurrent Engineering and Design-for-Safety); espoused value influences artifacts; and artifacts impact product safety performance. These hypotheses are tested by structural analyses of 255 survey responses collected from 126 firms in the juvenile product sector. While management commitment to safety, product safety culture, and Design-for-Safety are significant product safety predictors, as expected, Concurrent Engineering has no significant direct effect on product safety. We discuss the implications of these findings for the field of product safety."
Adam Anne-Flore,Fayolle,01/05/2016,anglais,Can implementation intention help to bridge the intention–behaviour gap in the entrepreneurial process?,"In order to understand what triggers action, researchers have studied intention and its determinants for decades. Specifically, entrepreneurship has been widely studied using the intention models. However, only few intended entrepreneurs enact their intentions in the end. As a proof, the variance explained by entrepreneurial intention in actual behaviour is estimated at 37%. So the entrepreneurial intention–behaviour link still has a lot to reveal, leaving a gap in the literature. This article first reminds the difference between goal intention and implementation intention and posits that intention models actually refer to goal intention only. As it has been proven in different contexts that by automatizing individuals’ responses to anticipated cues, implementation intention increases the probability to act, we propose to observe what could be the role of implementation intention in the entrepreneurial intention–behaviour link. The originality and main contribution of this experimental study is that it is the first attempt to operationalize implementation intention on such a complex behaviour. Even if the experiment enables us to make observations more than statistically valid findings, it paves the way for more empirical research on the subject, and it still allows to suggest what could be the benefit of using implementation intention in that field. It should now be tested on a larger scale to be statistically reliable."

This paper illustrates the results of a study aimed at developing and testing a model of store loyalty building in the fashion retail context. Hypothesis referring to loyalty antecedents have been derived from previous studies and are not only limited to the key relational variables already identified in the literature (trust, satisfaction and perceived value) but also to their antecedents among the retailing-mix levers to provide managerial directions to fashion retail managers. The developed model has been empirically tested. Data have been collected using a phone survey; the sample is composed of around 1,400 fashion retail customers. The most important result of the study are: the role of trust as a loyalty antecedent and the poor, and negative, role of salespeople within the model."

However, its interest into China’s infant formula market was quite recent. In 2007, Danone acquired International Nutrition Co., Ltd., which possessed the brand Dumex, one of the leading infant formula brands in Asia. Thanks to Dumex, China has become the largest market for Danone in baby nutrition, accounting for 4–5 % of its total company sales. A series of new regulations issued by the government sent a clear signal that Chinese authority was set to consolidate the infant formula industry and provide support for big domestic firms. The worsening regulatory environment and intensifying competition made Danone realize that it could no longer rely merely on Dumex. The company saw Dumex’s sales tumble as a result of the scandal."
Zhou Shuyu,Gong de Koster,01/05/2016,anglais,Designing Self-Storage Warehouses with Customer Choice,"Self-storage warehousing is a rapidly growing industry where consumers or companies can rent storage space for personal or company use, over a certain horizon. This paper addresses the question of how to design the facilities so that revenue can be maximized over a nite horizon, considering multiple demand requirements with respect to size, pricing, location within the facility, climate control, security, or outside access, among others. Using a customer choice model to specify the probability of purchase for each fare product as a function of the set of fare products offered, we propose methods to design self-storage warehouses while allowing different customer choice behaviors. We model the problem as a mixed-integer program and solve it using column generation and branch-and-price algorithms. In addition, we study the impact of re-layout and methods to modify facility layout, since self-storage facilities are relatively fexible in layout and individual storage compartments can be adapted to changes in demand. We validate our model using the data of four self-storage warehouses, and show our method can improve the expected revenue by nearly 11% on average for these cases."
Fayolle Alain,Jack Lamine Chabaud,30/04/2016,anglais,Entrepreneurial Process and Social Networks,"Entrepreneurship is undoubtedly a social process and creating a firm requires both the mobilization of social networks and the use of social capital. This book addresses the gap that exists between the need to take these factors into consideration and the understanding of how network relationships are developed and transformed across the venturing process. Expert contributions from key scholars in the field illustrate how social networks evolve across entrepreneurial stages, using studies from different regions across the world. Offering a comprehensive understanding, they emphasize the role of formal networks created inside professions and firms. Also examined is the impact of context, including both family and internationally variable institutions, that can help entrepreneurs to access resources and competencies useful for their projects. The book concludes by emphasizing the various research challenges: which theories are useful for our endeavours and which new methods can be used to understand the dynamics of the venturing process? Dynamic and eminently practical, this book will be invaluable to scholars and students studying the entrepreneurial process and the impact of social networks. It will also prove a useful tool in aiding entrepreneurs to optimize the development of their networks and better manage their entrepreneurial processes."
Fayolle Alain,Jack Lamine Chabaud,30/04/2016,anglais,Introduction,"By its very nature, entrepreneurship is processual and social (Aldrich and Zimmer, 1986). Even if these two observations are now largely consensual (Gedajlovic et al., 2013; Hoang and Antoncic, 2003; Slotte-Kock and Coviello, 2010), we observe a paradox. This observation about entrepreneurship was explicitly made very early on in the field in the seminal work of Aldrich and Zimmer (1986: 3), who emphasized ‘two essential issues that research on entrepreneurship must address: (1) entrepreneurship is a process and must be viewed in dynamic terms rather than in cross-sectional snapshots; and (2) entrepreneurship requires linkages or relations between key components of the process’. However, recent work by Slotte- Kock and Coviello (2010: 48) considered that ‘the entrepreneurship literature has only just begun to investigate how network relationships are developed and transformed’.The chapters in this book consider two essential issues relating to entrepreneurship: process and the social dimension. In dealing with these issues, this book aims to go ‘one step beyond’ (Lamine et al., 2015)1 with the aim of enhancing knowledge and understanding about these issues and so contribute to a better appreciation of the connection between the entrepreneurial process and social networks."
Lamine Wadid,Fayolle Chebbi,30/04/2016,anglais,Actor - network theory and the entrepreneurial process,"Research on entrepreneurial networks continues to grow. However, knowledge about the dynamics involved in building these networks over time remains limited. This lack is even more noticeable concerning studies on the pre-creation period of the entrepreneurial process. Drawing on Bruyat’s theory of entrepreneurship (2001), the authors examine the progressive creation of an entrepreneurial network over a two-year period."
Antonakis John,Bastardoz Jacquart Shamir,01/04/2016,anglais,Charisma,"We take historical stock of charisma, tracing its origins and how it has been conceptualized in the sociological and organizational sciences literatures. Although charisma has been intensely studied, the concept is still not well understood and much of the research undertaken cannot inform policy. We show that the major obstacles to advancing our understanding of charisma have included issues with its definition, its confusion with transformational leadership, the use of questionnaire measures, and that it has not been studied using correctly-specified causal models. To help spawn a new genre of research in charisma, we use signaling theory to provide a general definition of charisma, and make suggestions about how charisma should be conceptualized, operationalized, and modeled. We also describe trends and patterns in articles we reviewed, using co-citation as well as bibliometric analyses, and discuss the practical implications of our findings."
Ben Mahmoud Jouini Sihem,Midler Silberzahn,01/04/2016,anglais,Contributions of Design Thinking to Project Management in an Innovation Context,"Researchers have long recognized that standard approaches to project management are ill-suited to address changes in the environment or business needs, particularly in innovative contexts characterized by uncertainty and complexity. Instead of being concerned with the efficient implementation of a deliberate strategy, a project in such a context becomes a process for strategy formulation. Three imperatives for project management arise as a result: managing the explorative phase, managing the involvement of stakeholders in the project, and managing the project in relation to the strategizing process of the firm. We propose that design thinking, a recent evolution in the field of design, can make some important contributions to these imperatives. Design thinking has been highlighted by practitioners as well as academia as a novel methodology that is potentially valuable for improving innovative outcomes, whether they are products, services, or strategies. We examine and articulate these possible contributions through 10 propositions that could form an agenda for future experimentation and empirical research on innovation project management."
Ivens Björn Sven,Pardo,01/04/2016,anglais,Managerial implications of research on inter-organizational interfaces,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to identify what managerial implications research related to inter-organizational interfaces has been produced in marketing. For this aim, the authors focus on a specific concept implemented in many firms that operate on business-to-business markets, which is key account management (KAM). Design/methodology/approach – The authors used the Ebsco Database entering “account management” as a key word in the title row. The search provided 51 papers to which the authors added four MSI reports written by Moriarty and Shapiro between 1980 and 1984. The authors then identified such keywords as “managers”, “practitioners”, “marketers”, “managerial”, “business”, and their variations as well as normative words such as “should”, “must”, etc. in order to identify managerial implications. Findings – Four main findings are provided: a clear managerial purpose is affirmed by KAM academic works whether as a central “purpose” of the works or as “implications”; these managerial implications may display different forms (dimensions to be considered, consequences to anticipate, advices); though the managerial scope of KAM works is clearly visible, the sophistication of managerial recommendations remains … limited; the identification of who is exactly “the manager” targeted by the implications remains vague. Research limitations/implications – The authors discuss the notion of managerial relevance of academic research. Practical/implications – The authors explore sources for practices (whether they are the ones of scholars or managers) that could help “spelling out more effectively the managerial implications. Originality/value – To the knowledge this is the first work that reviews so precisely how academic articles address to the managerial audience on a precise issue. Furthermore, the authors believe that KAM is an interesting and appropriate field for such a review because it is widely implemented on business markets."
Mian Sarfraz,Lamine Fayolle,01/04/2016,anglais,Technology Business Incubation,"This paper introduces Technology Business Incubation (TBI) as a field of study and practice, exploring the concept, its evolution, and scholarship. Science parks, incubators and accelerators are TBI mechanisms considered to be important policy tools for supporting innovation and technology-oriented entrepreneurial growth. Their popularity is premised on the belief that these mechanisms provide critical value-added inputs essential for the creation and development of innovative Technology-Based Firms (TBFs). However, determining what type of TBI mechanisms and policies are most conducive to achieving the desired results is very much mission-driven and context-specific. A review of the past three decades of incubation literature, emerging practice, and future trends reveals that despite ongoing debate about their contribution and challenges, the future of TBIs is promising, and there are rich opportunities for research."
Pinho José Carlos,Prange,01/04/2016,anglais,The effect of social networks and dynamic internationalization capabilities on international performance,"This article explores the relationship between social networks and dynamic internationalization capabilities (DICs), and their impact on the international performance of small and medium-sized firms (SMEs) in low-tech industries. We distinguish between exploitative DICs (threshold and consolidation capabilities) and explorative DICs (value-adding and disruption capabilities). Our results, which are based on a sample of small and medium-sized Portuguese exporters, indicate that social networks are a relevant antecedent of exploitative and explorative DICs, and that consolidation and disruption capabilities positively affect international performance. Multiple mediation analysis confirms these relationships. The article concludes with a discussion of implications for research and practice."
Ramsey Jase,Abi Aad Jiang Lopes Barakat Drummond,01/04/2016,anglais,Emergence of Cultural Intelligence and Global Mindset Capital,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to establish under which conditions researchers should use the constructs cultural intelligence (CQ) and global mindset (GM). We further seek to understand the process through which these constructs emerge to a higher level, and link unit-level knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) capital to pertinent firm-level outcomes. Design/methodology/approach This paper is a conceptual study with a multilevel model. Findings This paper differentiates two similar lines of research occurring concordantly on the CQ and GM constructs. Next, we develop a multilevel model to better understand the process through which CQ and GM emerge at higher levels and their underlying mechanisms. Finally, this paper adds meaning to the firm-level KSAs by linking firm-level KSAs capital to pertinent firm-level outcomes. Research limitations/implications The conclusion implies that researchers should use CQ when the context is focused on interpersonal outcomes and GM when focused on strategic outcomes. The multilevel model is a useful tool for scholars to select which rubric to use in future studies that have international managers as the subjects. We argue that if the scholar is interested in an individual’s ability to craft policy and implement strategy, then GM may be more parsimonious than CQ. On the other hand, if the focus is on leadership, human resources, or any other relationship dependent outcome, then CQ will provide a more robust measure. Practical implications For practitioners, this study provides a useful tool for managers to improve individual-level commitment by selecting and training individuals high in cultural intelligence. On the other hand, if the desired outcome is firm-level sales or performance, we should focus on targeting individuals high in global mindset. Originality/value This is the first theoretical paper to examine how CQ and GM emerge to the firm-level and describe when to use each measure."
Seremani Tapiwa Winston,Clegg,01/04/2016,anglais,"Postcolonialism, Organization, and Management Theory","This article contributes a critical discussion of postcolonial theory. It opposes the binary nature of much contemporary discussion of the topic in theory and in organization and management theory in particular. We identify the challenges facing postcolonial theory, which we identify in epistemological terms. The dualism of “colonial” and “postcolonial” theory masks considerable diversity that the binary logic occludes. In place of this dualism, we introduce the notion of epistemological third spaces. As a theory of this third space, we introduce the indigenous theory of southern Africa, Ubuntu, discussing its interaction with more conventional Western management and organization theory. We also highlight a case in which the notion of epistemological third spaces would have been valuable had it been applied to the spread of the Nile River virus. We conclude the article with a discussion of the potential links between epistemological third spaces."
Bertoni Fabio,D'Adda Grilli,01/03/2016,anglais,Cherry-picking or frog-kissing?,"We propose a formal model that analyzes which entrepreneurial ventures actively seek and subsequently obtain venture capital (VC) financing in thin VC markets. The model shows that in thin VC markets, (1) VC investors will invest in companies in need (frog-kissing) rather than in best performers (cherry-picking), and (2) the best performing ventures will self-select out of the market for VC. These conclusions are in line with the results from the literature, which note that in Europe many entrepreneurial firms do not actively seek VC investment and that VC investors do not appear to possess the same cherry-picking ability that they have in the US."
Guerini Massimiliano,Quas,01/03/2016,anglais,Governmental venture capital in Europe,"This paper investigates the screening and certification abilities of government-managed venture capital (GVC) firms in Europe. Using a sample of European high-tech entrepreneurial companies, we show that GVC funding increases the likelihood that companies will receive private venture capital (PVC). Moreover, GVC-funded companies that have received a first round of PVC are at least as likely as other PVC-backed companies to receive a second round of PVC or to be listed or acquired. After ruling out alternative explanations, we interpret these results as positive evidence of GVC firms' abilities in selecting promising companies and certifying them to PVC investors."

Laamanen Tomi,Lamberg Vaara,01/03/2016,anglais,Explanations of success and failure in management learning,"In this paper, we study the changing explanations of success and failure over the course of a firm's history. We build on a discursive approach that highlights the role of narrative attributions in making sense of corporate performance. Specifically, we analyze how the Nokia Corporation was framed first as a success and later as a failure and how these dimensions of performance were explained in various actors' narrative accounts. In both the success and failure accounts, our analysis revealed a striking black-and-white picture that resulted in the institutionalization of Nokia's metanarratives of success and failure. Our findings also reveal a number of discursive attributional tendencies; and thus warn of the cognitive and politically motivated biases that are likely to characterize management literature."

Guerrero Maribel,Urbano Fayolle,01/02/2016,anglais,Entrepreneurial activity and regional competitiveness,"The interesting relationship between entrepreneurial activity and regional competitiveness has been a major focus of academics, university managers, and policy makers during the past decades—in particular the role of institutions in the establishment of political, social, and economic rules-. For example, since the enactment of the US Bayh–Dole Act more than 30 years ago, many American cities and regions are increasingly viewing universities as potential engines of economic growth. In these new socioeconomic scenarios, the role of entrepreneurial universities is not only generates/transfers knowledge but also contributes/provides leadership for the creation of entrepreneurial thinking, actions, and institutions. Previous studies have shown the university’s role in economic development, but no empirical study has analyzed the entrepreneurial activity generated by university students per university at the country/regional level of analysis. The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of the university’s entrepreneurial activity on regional competitiveness. Adopting the institutional economics and the endogenous growth approaches, a proposed conceptual framework was developed and tested with structural equation modeling using data from 102 universities located in 56 NUTS II of 12 European countries. Our results evidenced that informal factors (e.g., attitudes, role models) have a higher influence on university entrepreneurial activity than formal factors (e.g., support measures, education and training). Our results also evidenced a higher contribution of universities on regional competitiveness, in particular, when we used social measures (talent human capital) instead economic measures (GDP per capita)."
WANG Tao,Wezel Forgues,01/02/2016,anglais,Protecting Market Identity,"This article examines the conditions under which organizations publicly respond to unfavorable consumer evaluations that challenge their market identity. Because organizations' market identities are certified by expert evaluations, consumers' devaluations that challenge these expert evaluations represent an identity threat. However, organizations do not always react to consumers' devaluations because of the risks associated to public responses. Hence, we first predict that organizations are more likely to respond to severe devaluations than to weaker ones; second, we propose that organizations, when faced with severe devaluations, are more likely to craft responses that justify their actions and behaviors. We further contend that, for any market identity under consideration, an organization's reputation amplifies these relationships. Analyses of a dataset of London hoteliers' responses to online reviews posted on TripAdvisor during the period 2002-2012 lend substantial support to our hypotheses."
Courpasson David,,01/01/2016,anglais,Impactful Resistance,"Contrary to an ontology of defeatism that permeates scholarship on resistance, this paper suggests a perspective through which resistance can lead to hope and the unlikely victory of the powerless against the powerful.

The paper engages with recent accounts of postrecognition politics that largely deny the willingness of workers to struggle about issues related to work."
Courpasson David,Dany Marti,01/01/2016,anglais,Organizational Entrepreneurship as Active Resistance,"This paper aims to contribute to the emerging perspective on organizational entrepreneurship by outlining how resistance to managerial policies and decisions can give birth to alternative organizational styles. Drawing on an in-depth analysis of a personal narrative of an R&D team manager opposition to hierarchical decisions, we link studies on resistance and organizational entrepreneurship to suggest that active resistance, which we define as the capacity to live beyond managerial control to create spaces of creativity and solidarity and alternative modalities of work in an organizational context, can actually contribute to the entrepreneurial process."
Geiler Philipp,Renneboog,01/01/2016,anglais,Executive Remuneration and the Payout Decision,"We analyze the payout channel choice of listed UK firms and examine whether the choice between dividends, share repurchases, a combination of payout channels, or complete earnings retention is affected by investor sentiment, taxation, major shareholder ownership, and in particular the CEO's compensation package. The payout choice can have an immediate effect on the value of the CEO's stock options and restricted stock, whereby anticipated dividends drive down the value of her equity-based pay if it is not dividend-protected whereas share repurchases may have a positive impact. We use a quantile regression analysis to examine various payout scenarios as well as a nested logit model which studies payout choice conditional on changing payout levels. We find that it is the CEO's personal wealth as reflected by her compensation package rather than shareholder preferences which has the strongest impact on the firm's payout policy."
Heine Klaus,Phan Atwal,01/01/2016,anglais,Authenticity and prestige,"As some centuries-old wineries are amongst the oldest brands in the world, they may keep some important marketing insights. The paper suggests that wineries are setting the benchmark regarding two essential characteristics that all luxury brands must fulfil to at least some extent: authenticity and prestige. While the luxury wine segment provides guidance on developing authenticity - the winemaker's benchmark, the champagne segment provides guidance on creating prestige - the champagne benchmark. Based on literature analysis, the conceptual part of the paper discusses the meaning of authenticity and prestige. A case study on Château d'Yquem shows how winemakers have set a benchmark in creating authenticity, and a case study on Veuve Clicquot shows how champagne brands provide a benchmark in creating prestige. The lessons learned from the luxury wine industry may also be useful in many other industries. As an illustration, we apply the authenticity and prestige-building techniques to the fashion segment."
Hong Soonkwan,Vicdan,01/01/2016,anglais,Re-imagining the utopian,"This research elucidates the transformative nature of sustainable lifestyles in ecovillages as ostensibly utopian spaces. Using archival data from several ecovillages, in-depth interviews with ecovillage residents, and participatory observations made at the EcoVillage at Ithaca (EVI), New York, and Imeceevi, Turkey, the article explains the processes by which utopian ideals are re-imagined and re-configured based on the social configuration of the sustainable lifestyle. The findings suggest that consumers organize alternative life modes in their quest to explore and internalize environmentally sustainable lifestyles in multi-faceted ideological fields. The study documents the transformation of ecovillages from intentional to incidentally utopian communities where residents equally prioritize and contest relational sustainability. Drawing on these findings, the article also presents public policy implications on new educational programs and sharing economy."
Hottegindre Géraldine,Lesage Baker,01/01/2016,anglais,Disciplinary practices in the French auditing profession,"Purpose– The purpose of this paper is to contribute to understand the role of the statutory auditing profession in France. The study is theoretically based on distinctions between a functionalist view of professions and a neo-weberian view. Prior research, conducted in Anglo-American countries has shown that the auditing profession has focussed primarily on protecting the private interests of the profession. Hence, there is a need to conduct research on this topic in a code law country where the state is expected to play a significant role in protecting the public interest. Design/methodology/approach– The methodology involves a content analysis of 148 disciplinary decisions issued against statutory auditors in France from 1989 to 2006. This analysis identified 21 types of violations grouped into public interest or private interest offences. Because visible offences are public and are more likely to threaten the reputation of the profession, these types of decisions are also studied with respect to their visibility. Findings– The results reveal that in a code law country such as France the auditing profession tends to defend both the public interest as well as its private interests. The results also support the “visibility” effect. Research limitations/implications– The written disciplinary decisions have been anonymized so that the names of the auditors and the clients cannot be identified. Originality/value– This paper differs from previous studies conducted in the Anglo-American context which show an emphasis on protecting the private interests of the auditing profession. Moreover, this study reveals the existence of “mixed” offences and underlines that a profession primarily focusses on these cases. Thus, the work reconciles in part the functionalist and neo-weberian perspectives. Lastly, this paper confirms the importance of the visibility effect."
Karthikeyan Soorjith Illickal,Jonsson Wezel,01/01/2016,anglais,The Travails of Identity Change,"How does an organization change its identity, yet maintain distinctiveness? This question is especially interesting when we consider the fact that identity repositioning often takes place among several organizations at the same time—giving rise to interrelated identity change and distinctiveness concerns. We investigate this question in the setting of British political parties, during a period when questions of identity change and distinctiveness were heightened, following a decline of political ideologies. Parties, we argue, sought to handle this situation through two broad strategies that we call identity affirmation and reformation. Identity distinctiveness was affirmed by identity claims that sought to counter and neutralize competing claims on aspects that were thought central to the identity of the party. To alter the identity, parties also sought to reform it by expanding identity claims to elements that were considered to be popular. Reformation efforts are however not unchecked expansion, but tempered by concerns of identity consistency and distance from other parties. We discuss contributions to theories of organizational identities and competitive rivalry."

This review provides an understanding of key issues in organizational narrative analysis with a focus on the role of narratives in organizational stability and change. We start by elaborating on the characteristics of organizational narratives to provide a conceptual framework for organizational narrative analysis. We elaborate on three key approaches to narrative analysis on stability and change: realist, interpretative, and poststructuralist. We then review several topic areas where narrative analysis has so far offered the most promise: organizational change, identity, strategy, entrepreneurship, and personal change. Finally, we identify important issues that warrant attention in future research, both theoretically and methodologically."

Bertoni Fabio,Croce Guerini,01/12/2015,anglais,Venture Capital and the Investment Curve of Young High-Tech Companies,"We explore how and when venture capital (VC) alleviates the financial constraints of portfolio companies. Using a sample comprising 128 VC-backed companies and 233 non-VC-backed companies identified by propensity score matching, we estimate an error-correction model by accounting for the fact that the investment curve may be U shaped because of capital market imperfections. Our findings show that VC leads the investment curve to flatten in portfolio companies, which indicates an alleviation of financial constraints. This effect, however, is economically and statistically significant only after companies receive a follow-on round of VC financing. Because follow-on rounds, on average, do not involve larger amounts invested but have stronger informative content than initial rounds of investment, we interpret this result to indicate the importance of VC certification for the alleviation of financial constraints in portfolio companies. Evidence regarding the access to credit by VC-backed companies confirms this interpretation of the results."
Geiler Philipp,Renneboog,01/12/2015,anglais,Are Female Top Managers Really Paid Less?,"We study the gender pay gap for all top managers (CEO and executive directors) of listed UK companies and find mixed evidence: female CEOs do not face a pay gap, but the other female executive directors (e.g. CFO, COO, Deputy CEO) are discriminated against (while controlling for position, tenure, age, industry, time period, marital status, and parenthood). These female top managers earn about 23% less than their male counterparts, which amounts to £1.3 million over a five-year period (their average tenure as an executive at the board level). The gender pay gap is lower for managers in firms with female non-executive directors on the board. Also, female managers working in 'male' industries experience a smaller pay gap. When remuneration contracting occurs with the help of top remuneration, we note that the total remuneration offered to top managers is higher but the pay gap for executive directors still remains (but not for the CEO). The gender pay gap increases in case of marriage and parenthood."

Drawing on a qualitative study of the post-merger integration between a French and Dutch airline where English was adopted as a lingua franca, we illustrate how language fluency influences the ability of individuals to give meaning to their changed circumstances. Moreover, we elaborate on how language fluency indexes social groupings and identities, and may thus be a driver of perceptions of status inequality and identity politics between different groups of employees. With our study we draw attention to the multi-faceted role of English as a lingua franca. Our findings also contribute to research on sociocultural dynamics associated with post-merger integration and the role of language in mergers and acquisitions, as well as in multinational companies more generally."
Linan Francisco,Fayolle,01/12/2015,anglais,A systematic literature review on entrepreneurial intentions,"Entrepreneurial intention is a rapidly evolving field of research. A growing number of studies use entrepreneurial intention as a powerful theoretical framework. However, a substantial part of this research lacks systematization and categorization, and there seems to be a tendency to start anew with every study. Therefore, there is a need to take stock of current knowledge in this field. In this sense, this paper carries out a review of the literature on entrepreneurial intentions. A total of 409 papers addressing entrepreneurial intention, published between 2004 and 2013 (inclusive), have been analyzed. The purpose and contribution of this paper is to offer a clearer picture of the sub-fields in entrepreneurial intention research, by concentrating on two aspects. Firstly, it reviews recent research by means of a citation analysis to categorize the main areas of specialization currently attracting the attention of the academic community. Secondly, a thematic analysis is carried out to identify the specific themes being researched within each category. Despite the large number of publications and their diversity, the present study identifies five main research areas, plus an additional sixth category for a number of new research papers that cannot be easily classified into the five areas. Within those categories, up to twenty-five different themes are recognized. A number of research gaps are singled out within each of these areas of specialization, in order to induce new ways and perspectives in the entrepreneurial intention field of research that may be fruitful in filling these gaps."

Unlike existing research, we find that technologyrelated factors did not play a role in the catching up processes, yet supply-chain management did. Consistent with the existing literature, we find that policy-related factors (government intervention) and market- knowledge related factors (learning) but also hardly mentioned additional market- knowledge related factors such as managerial mobility and local advantages played a major role."

Starting from the consideration that family is an intimate and essential aspect of entrepreneurship, this book considers connections between family, family members, entrepreneurial behavior, family business, society and the economy. Bringing together a unique range of international contributions, it offers new theoretical perspectives and empirical insights as well as an in-depth consideration of the diversity of contexts and processes associated with entrepreneurship in family settings. Above all, this book opens up a comprehensive research agenda on the linkages between family, family firms and entrepreneurship and will be of interest to researchers, educators and advanced students of entrepreneurship, small firms and family business."

Exploratory research, based on the analysis of four cases of a service outsourcing negotiation process, leads to a series of proposals that form the basis for a further research agenda. Our findings suggest that negotiating behavior in service outsourcing can be explained by the power relationship, time pressure and, in particular, by the type of service outsourced. The latter appears to influence the impact of other contextual factors on negotiating behavior."
Versaevel Bruno,,01/12/2015,anglais,"Alertness, Leadership, and Nascent Market Dynamics","In a continuous-time model with uncertain market development, two potential entrants detect a nascent demand only if it reaches a firm-specific threshold. Entry occurs by investing irreversibly before competing in quantities. When leadership in the investment stage implies a first-mover advantage in the market stage, we examine how the firms’ relative “alertness” drives the equilibrium outcomes. If the firms detect the new demand relatively late, the entry strategies and resulting firm values differ qualitatively from those in standard real option games: (1) In case of symmetric detection, the probability of simultaneous entry is nonzero, and can be one, although demand is still nascent. When sequential entry occurs, there is no rent equalization, with the post-entry market advantage, resulting in higher equilibrium expected value to the leader; (2) in case of asymmetric detection, entry is always sequential, and the more alert firm maximizes value by delaying its investment to enter exactly when its short-sighted rival detects demand. The marginal effect of the market advantage on the leader’s equilibrium value increases in the inter-firm alertness differential; and (3) more demand volatility reduces the value differential across firms and makes less likely the impact of imperfect alertness on entry decisions."

DESMAISON Gérard,Moore,01/11/2015,anglais,In Search of Sustainable Firm Performance,"Sustainable prosperity is a key to the success of companies of the 21st century. In their quest for sustained economic performance, firms are challenged to identify the endogenous drivers of their performance, notably the performance measurement system, the stakeholder economic value creation processes, and appropriate management methods and practices, and to validate the coherence among them. Among these many factors, the sustainability of the methods of management plays a critical role in helping to achieve the overall performance of the firm. The question therefore is how to develop and practice sustainable methods of management in companies in order to improve the overall performance of the actors and reconcile organizational change with high levels of satisfaction. Given the fact that the concept of sustainability is multi-faceted, however, we will first outline our approach to the concept in utilizing it as an illustration of overall economic performance"
Le Courtois Olivier,Menoncin,01/11/2015,anglais,Portfolio optimisation with jumps,"In this paper, we address portfolio optimisation when stock prices follow general Lévy processes in the context of a pension accumulation scheme. The optimal portfolio weights are obtained in quasi-closed form and the optimal consumption in closed form. To solve the optimisation problem, we show how to switch back and forth between the stochastic differential and standard exponentials of the Lévy processes. We apply this procedure to both the Variance Gamma process and a Lévy process whose arrival rate of jumps exponentially decreases with size. We show through a numerical example that when jumps, and therefore asymmetry and leptokurtosis, are suitably taken into account, then the optimal portfolio share of the risky asset is around half that obtained in the Gaussian framework."
Perezts Mar,Picard,01/11/2015,anglais,Compliance or Comfort Zone?,"The effective implementation of regulation in organizations is an ongoing concern for both research and practice, in order to avoid deviant behavior and its consequences. However, the way compliance with regulations is actually enacted or “performed” within organizations instead of merely executed, remains largely under-characterized. Evidence from an ethnographic study in the compliance unit of a French investment bank allows us to develop a detailed practice approach to how regulation is actually implemented in firms. We characterize the work accomplished by compliance analysts who are in fact, “curving” the script of regulation within what we conceptualize as a “comfort zone”. Beyond agency, ethics appears as a key element in linking the “letter of the law”, which serves as a referential anchor to guide action, with the complex nature of specific situations. We analyze the way individuals and compliance teams cope with, interpret, struggle and in fine, perform regulation within this comfort zone. A particular interest is thus given to the work of embedded ethics in this process, as an enabler to partly recouple compliance with the regulated activity. We find that blind execution is not only impossible, but also devoid of meaning both from regulatory, risk management, and business perspectives in organizations. We highlight and characterize a hermeneutic dimension to this work, essential to effectively perform regulation in complex environments, and we suggest some directions for further research."
Sinaceur Marwan,Kopelman Vasiljevic Haag,01/11/2015,anglais,Weep and get more,"Although recently some research has been accumulated on emotional expressions in negotiations, there is little research on whether expressing sadness could have any effect in negotiations. We propose that sadness expressions can increase the expressers’ ability to claim value in negotiations because they make recipients experience greater other-concern for the expresser. However, only when the social situation provides recipients with reasons to experience concern for the expresser in the first place, will recipients act on their other-concern and, eventually, concede more to a sad expresser. Three experiments tested this proposition by examining face-to-face, actual negotiations (in which participants interacted with each other). In all 3 experiments, recipients conceded more to a sad expresser when, but only when, features of the social situation provided reasons to experience other-concern for the expresser, namely (a) when recipients perceived the expresser as low power (Experiment 1), (b) when recipients anticipated a future interaction (Experiment 1), (c) when recipients construed the relationship as collaborative in nature (Experiment 2), or (d) when recipients believed that it was inappropriate to blame others (Experiment 3). All 3 experiments showed that the positive effect of sadness expression was mediated by the recipients’ greater other-concern. These findings extend previous research on emotional expressions in negotiations by emphasizing a distinct psychological mechanism. Implications for our understanding of sadness, negotiations, and emotions are discussed."
Vernuccio Maria,Pagani Barbarossa Pastore,01/11/2015,anglais,Antecedents of brand love in online network-based communities,"Purpose This paper aims to analyse the antecedents of brand love in online network-based communities and to develop an integrative conceptual model in which social-interactive engagement influences brand love via the mediating effects of social identity. Design/methodology/approach A survey was conducted on the Facebook fan pages of 20 leading international brands. A total of 387 responses were collected from consumers living primarily in Europe and the US. Structural equation modelling was performed to test the hypothesised linkages. Findings The results confirmed that the positive influence of social-interactive engagement on brand love is mediated by the psychological effects related to how members perceive their self-concept based on belonging to the social group of the brand fan page. Research limitations/implications This study considered Facebook, the favourite social network used by customers to connect with brands. Future research is invited to consider other social media in order to increase the external validity of the model. Practical implications In order to strengthen the emotional bond with a brand in online network-based communities, managers should stimulate consumers’ social identity by leveraging on the experiences which influence social-interactive engagement. Originality/value This study is the first to investigate the effects of social-interactive engagement on social identity in order to enhance the understanding of brand love’s antecedents in specific online social environments."

Fayolle Alain,Riot,15/10/2015,anglais,Rethinking Entrepreneurship,"Entrepreneurship is a growing field of research, attracting researchers from many different disciplines including economics, sociology, psychology, and management. The concept of entrepreneurship, and research in the field, is becoming institutionalized, increasingly oriented by influential trends, theories and methods, following the mainstream and being shaped accordingly. The objective of this book is to move beyond mainstream approaches and assumptions which are dominating the field, and to raise questions about the nature and process of entrepreneurship research. Over twelve chapters, leading international thinkers in the field debate the impact and the consequences of institutionalization. Taking key research orientations including multidisciplinarity, international entrepreneurship, social entrepreneurship, and ethics, it takes a critical and constructive and sometimes controversial posture and encourages a re-examination of the way we look at the social and economic phenomenon of entrepreneurship. This book is vital reading for entrepreneurship researchers and educators, advanced students and policy-makers in Entrepreneurship, Economics, Sociology and Psychology."
Bertoni Fabio,Colombo Quas,01/10/2015,anglais,The patterns of venture capital investment in Europe,"We study the investment strategies of different types of Venture Capital investors (VCs) using a unique dataset that includes 1,663 VC first investments made by 846 investors in 737 young high-tech entrepreneurial ventures located in seven European countries between 1994 and 2004. Using a transformed Balassa index, we analyze the relative investment specialization of independent VCs, corporate VCs, bank-affiliated VCs and governmental VCs along several dimensions that characterize investments (e.g., syndication, duration and exit mode) and investee companies (e.g., industry of operation, age, size, development stage, location and distance from investor’s premises at the time of the investment). Our findings indicate that VC types in Europe differ markedly in their patterns of investment specialization, especially governmental VC on the one side and private VC on the other. We compare our findings with evidence from the USA and find some interesting differences, notably regarding independent and governmental VCs."
Calvet Laurent E.,Czellar,01/10/2015,anglais,Accurate Methods for Approximate Bayesian Computation Filtering,"The Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) filter extends the particle filtering methodology to general state-space models in which the density of the observation conditional on the state is intractable. We provide an exact upper bound for the mean squared error of the ABC filter, and derive sufficient conditions on the bandwidth and kernel under which the ABC filter converges to the target distribution as the number of particles goes to infinity. The optimal convergence rate decreases with the dimension of the observation space but is invariant to the complexity of the state space. We show that the adaptive bandwidth commonly used in the ABC literature can lead to an inconsistent filter. We develop a plug-in bandwidth guaranteeing convergence at the optimal rate, and demonstrate the powerful estimation, model selection, and forecasting performance of the resulting filter in a variety of examples."
Calvet Laurent E.,Czellar RONCHETTI,01/10/2015,anglais,Robust Filtering,"Filtering methods are powerful tools to estimate the hidden state of a statespace model from observations available in real time. However, they are known to be highly sensitive to the presence of small misspeciﬁcations of the underlying model and to outliers in the observation process. In this paper, we show that the methodology of robust statistics can be adapted to sequential ﬁltering. We deﬁne a ﬁlter as being robust if the relative error in the state distribution caused by misspeciﬁcations is uniformly bounded by a linear function of the perturbation size. Since standard ﬁlters are nonrobust even in the simplest cases, we propose robustiﬁed ﬁlters which provide accurate state and parameter inference in the presence of model misspeciﬁcations. In particular, the robust particle ﬁlter naturally mitigates the degeneracy problems that plague the bootstrap particle ﬁlter (Gordon, Salmond and Smith, 1993) and its many extensions. We illustrate the good properties of robust ﬁlters in linear and nonlinear state-space examples."
Crespin-Mazet Florence,Ingemansson Havenvid Linne,01/10/2015,anglais,Antecedents of project partnering in the construction industry,"This paper aims at increasing the understanding of construction partnering and relationships in project marketing by analyzing the impact of previous relationships among project stakeholders on the choice of partnering and of partners. Based on a conceptual framework combining the insights of the Industrial Network Approach with the model of project co-development proposed by Crespin-Mazet and Ghauri (2007), the paper analyzes a focal partnering project and its connections to other projects. It concludes that the context of the relationships seems to influence the customer's selection of partnering and partners. The paper's contributions address the relative importance of the project's functional challenge and relational congruence in the project network on the customer's procurement choice. For a first partnering agreement, this choice seems primarily influenced by the project's functional challenge while the subsequent choice of partners relies on high relational congruence. Once a positive experience of project partnering gained, the customer's choice seems primarily influenced by the relational congruence in the project network so as to harvest previous investments (resource adaptations) made in their relationship with a given partner. The paper highlights several contributions to the construction partnering literature and project marketing literature."
Grosso Monica,Castaldo,01/10/2015,anglais,How store attributes impact shoppers' loyalty,"This paper takes a first step toward verifying the robustness of a comprehensive loyalty building model across different national cultures, according to Hofstede’s distinction between individualist and collectivist countries. To this end, we test a two-stage model. After collecting data from 12 countries with different cultural traits, we test the two models in two macro groups: individualist and collectivist countries. The study’s results show that the intensity of some core loyalty model paths – particularly the relationships between store loyalty and its main drivers (perceived value and customer satisfaction) – are contingent on the country’s culture. In particular, the impact of customer satisfaction on store loyalty intention is greater in collectivist countries than in individualist countries. By contrast, the impact of perceived value on store loyalty is greater in individualist than in collectivist countries. Moreover, the cultural dimension moderates the impact of the stores’ environment and promotions on satisfaction. By contrast, some other paths show robustness to national culture."

This special issue of Entrepreneurship & Regional Development begins to address these challenges by presenting a range of current works that further increase our understanding about social network dynamics during the entrepreneurial process. We begin by connecting this special issue to some of the main challenges of the field of entrepreneurship. From this, we propose an integrative perspective required to move thinking forward. We then summarize how the diverse papers presented in this special issue contribute to opening up the research field further and help us develop a greater understanding about the challenges entrepreneurship scholars face. We conclude this article with lessons and suggestions for future research."

In drawing upon insights from a 2-year ethnographic study of the Spanish’s Plataforma de Afectados por la Hipoteca (Mortgage Victims Platform), known as the PAH, this article centers on the mobilization of rather unlikely citizens to a process in which most of them never thought they would be part of.

Nairn Agnès,Spotswood,01/09/2015,anglais,"Obviously in the cool group they wear designer things""""","Purpose This paper proposes the lens of Social Practice Theory (SPT) as a means of deepening insight into childhood consumer culture. Design/methodology/approach The data comprises four qualitative interviews and ten focus groups with 58 8-13 year olds in 6 diverse schools across England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Transcripts were coded with NVIVO10. Analysis was guided by the three elements of Social Practice Theory: Materials, Meaning and Competence. Findings Branded technology products and clothes consistently combined with both the socially sanctioned objective of achieving and maintaining a place in the peer hierarchy and also the three skills we have labelled ‘social consumption recognition’, ‘social consumption performance’ and social consumption communication’ in regular, predictable ways to produce an ordered and thus reproduce-able nexus of actions. Analysis of the inter-relationship between these elements showed that children’s consumption is a specific practice; embedded in their everyday routines. Consumption is also linked inextricably to social position; children’s variable performance of it links with their degree of social acceptance and popularity. Research limitations/implications Although the study included a broad cross-section of school catchment areas they cannot be said to represent all British children. Nonetheless SPT provides an alternative theoretical perspective on children’s consumption by shifting the focus away from the child, the social context or even the products, thus ceasing to privilege the notion that consumption is something external to children that they learn to be socialised into; or to consciously use for their own symbolic or other purposes; or that they have to be protected from. Originality/value This SPT analysis of children’s consumption makes three contributions. Firstly it provides a much needed new theoretical perspective beyond the dominant but limited ‘consumer socialisation’ research paradigm that confines analysis of children’s consumption to the functioning of their individual cognitive capacity. Secondly it suggests new research methodologies for understanding the interaction between children and the commercial world. Thirdly it offers a different approach to policy makers tasked with the controversial issue of regulating marketing to children."
Pardo Catherine,Michel,01/09/2015,anglais,Dynamics in a distribution triad,"Purpose This work deals with business to business distribution with a strong focus on the relationships developed by a distributor with its customers and its producers. Design/methodology/approach This work is based on an in-depth analysis of a wholesaler specialized in fresh fruit and vegetable distribution. Data was gathered on the basis of 18 in-depth interviews. An additional important work of second-order data analysis was also conducted (sector analyses; statistics; companies’ websites...) Findings This work qualifies the different stages a wholesaler goes through in the relationships with its suppliers on the one side and its customers on the other. This work also identifies the nature of the impact of one type of relationship (wholesalers / producers) on the other (wholesalers / customers). Practical implications The findings allow distribution firms to view distribution channels as places where they can have some latitude to find new positions other than the ones imposed by producers. Originality/value This research uses different concepts connected with triadic settings (dynamics, triggers, interconnectedness) and integrates them to provide a new perspective on how a BtoB distributor can take a position in a distribution channel."

Rekik Yacine,SYNTETOS JEMAI,01/09/2015,anglais,An e-Retailing Supply Chain Subject to Inventory Inaccuracies,"One of the implicit assumptions considered in the majority of investigations performed in the area of inventory management is that the physical flow of products in an inventory system is free from defects. The same is hypothesized for the associated information flow. However, various factors may create a difference between the actual physical and information system (IS) flows and perturb their synchronized evolution. The implications of such a discrepancy are particularly prevalent in contemporary supply chains, where sales commitments are based on IS records only. In this paper we model and analyze the impact of inventory inaccuracies on supply chain performance. We first provide an overview of potential errors that may occur within an inventory system and we then propose a general framework to model the impact of inaccuracy errors. Potential errors in both the physical and/or the IS record inventories are considered and optimal analytical solutions are provided for both centralized and decentralized (coordinated and uncoordinated) supply chains for three plausible scenarios: inaccuracy errors are ignored; errors are estimated; the utilization of a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology enables the reduction of the relevant errors. The performance improvements enabled by the availability of error related information and the RFID technology are assessed and managerial insights are provided. The paper concludes with the implications of our work for supply chain design as well as with an agenda for further research in this area."
Cova Bernard,Pardo Salle Spencer,01/08/2015,anglais,Normal vs spectacular science,"This paper endeavours to track the underlying scientific process driving research activities and output. It takes research in the business-to-business field as the empirical setting and puts the works of the IMP Group into focus, using bibliometric analyses and historical vistas as background evidence. We argue that what may appear at first sight as a limited development should rather, in fact, be interpreted as “normal science,” i.e. based on the robustness of the core models and conceptual framework, with fine adjustments of these taking place over time. Indeed, the BtoB realm—and in particular the activities and production of the IMP Group and associated researchers—would seem to contrast rather radically with the broader area of marketing in that it benefits from a resistant conceptual framework which seems to have weathered the test of time, and which can be used as a building block for research development and is less sensitive to managerial trends and fashion."
Jacquart Philippe,Antonakis,01/08/2015,anglais,When does charisma matter for top-level leaders? Effect of attributional ambiguity,"One stream of leadership theory suggests leaders are evaluated via inferential observer processes that compare the fit of the target to a prototype of an ideal (charismatic) leader. Attributional theories of leadership suggest that evaluations depend on knowledge of past organizational performance, which is attributed to the leader’s skills. We develop a novel theory showing how inferential and attributional processes simultaneously explain top-level leader evaluation and ultimately leader retention and selection. We argue that observers will mostly rely on attributional mechanisms when performance signals clearly indicate good or poor performance outcomes. However, under conditions of attributional ambiguity (i.e., when performance signals are unclear), observers will mostly rely on inferential processes. In Study 1 we tested our theory in an unconventional context—the U.S. presidential election—and found that the two processes, due to the leader’s charisma and country economic performance, interact in predicting whether a leader is selected. Using a business context and an experimental design, in Study 2 we show that CEO charisma and firm performance interact in predicting leader retention, confirming the results we found in Study 1. Our results suggest that this phenomenon is quite general and can apply to various performance domains."

We ran a between-subjects experiment in three countries (Italy, Germany, and Spain) with three different versions of commercials (English only, dubbed in the local language, and subtitled in the local language) and assessed the effect of three different versions of the ads on attitude-towards-the-ad and on attitude-towards-the-brand. Results indicate that English-only adverts were less preferred than the alternatives and led to lower brand attitudes as well. This result was consistent for three advertised products (mobile phone, canned drink, and automobile) and replicated in all three countries, showing that this effect is robust."

Buch-Hansen Hubert,Levallois,01/07/2015,anglais,The Scale and Geography of Collusion in the European Market,"Europe has a long history of cartels, but the changes in the scale and geography of collusion in the European market from the post-war decades until the present have not been systematically investigated. Using network analysis methods and an original dataset based on decisions in EU cartel cases, this paper maps the developments in detected collusion in the European market from 1958 to 2008 and tentatively explains these developments. It appears that collusive activities increased during the 1960s and after the mid-1980s and that a long decline in the scale of collusion began in the mid-1990s. Moreover, the geographical spread of collusive activities in Europe increased considerably from 1969 to 1993. To facilitate an explanation of these and other findings, the paper presents a three-dimensional analytical framework that emphasises the importance of anti-cartel regulation, major changes in the business environment and the size of national economies."

While we can identify investors’ tax-driven preferences for a specific payout channel, we find no evidence of tax-induced clienteles. Firms do indeed not cater to the tax preferences of their shareholders (including individuals, pension funds, corporations). Other factors, such as equity-based compensation received by the CEO and investor sentiment in the form of optimism reduce the dividend payout and increase the use of share repurchases."

We also discover the factors that intensify experiencing the other and make attending high society bazaars as consumption venues alluring for upper and lower social classes, respectively representing the westernized and traditional social elements in Turkey, where the West meets the East. Findings from in-depth and focus-group interviews unravel the motives of encountering and experiencing the other and allow us to revisit and extend different theoretical insights by recognizing more recent cultural trends and consumer sensibilities that guide and motivate consumers to seek multiplicity, difference, and navigation."

The present paper examined how personal life behavior affects leaders. We assessed high proﬁle political sex scandals to explore the research questions of how indiscretions in personal life affect leaders and how leaders recover from public revelations of sexual indiscretions. The results revealed that whether politicians survived the scandal depended on (a) the degree to which the indiscretion deviated from accepted norms, (b) the degree to which the behavior departed from the politician’s expressed values, (c) the leader’s political power (or value), and (d) whether the leader fully engaged in atonement under conditions when denying the allegations is not possible. These components were inter-related such that atonement was possible if the behavior was neither too extreme nor out of character and the leader had sufﬁcient political power. The model was then tested with a sample of business executives engaged in sex scandals, ﬁnding support for its elements."
Puyou François-Régis,Faÿ,01/06/2015,anglais,Cogs in the Wheel or Spanners in the Works?,"The aim of this paper is to propose a new perspective on the difficulty and meaning of ethical work for financial controllers. This is achieved by drawing on concepts from Michel Henry’s phenomenology of life in the field of business ethics. The French philosopher Michel Henry (1922–2002) is distinguished by his identifying two modes of appearing: ‘intentionality’ (appearing of the world through representations) and ‘affectivity’ (appearing of life). Henry suggests that relying only on abstract representations constitutes a specific ideology that causes individuals at work to ignore the actual experience of being affected, and hinders the appearance of life to guide their actions, in turn hindering ethics. Empirical illustrations are provided by a case study that explores the practices of management accountants in a travel retail corporation. By observing the empirical practices of management accountants, a body of professionals whose role is largely dependent on information technology, abstraction and technical expertise to trace organisational flows and transactions, we shed light on the difficult ethical issues associated with their role of surveillance and control of other managers’ work. The case study illustrates a wide range of everyday working practices among management accountants. Some convey the impression that they lack empathy and consideration for other individuals, while others engage in close cooperation and ethical practices despite the constraining configuration of their role. A significant result of this research is that it illustrates and interprets, based on Henry’s phenomenology, a wide range of working practices. Consistent with Henry, we argue that the source of business ethics lies beyond professional standards, codes and values."
Adam Anne-Flore,Fayolle,01/05/2015,anglais,Bridging the entrepreneurial intention-behavior gap,"Since the 1980s, many authors have studied the entrepreneurial process based on the intention models developed in the sociopsychological literature. Determinants of intention were defined, but as shown by Ajzen (1987), no direct link was established between intention and action: intentions were found to explain only about 30% of the variance in behavior. Some authors tried to bridge this gap, by focusing more specifically on environmental factors. Our paper is in line with works by Shane, Locke and Collins (2003), in studying factors at the micro level. Drawing on the sociopsychological literature, it focuses on two psychological factors that can explain why some people with entrepreneurial intentions act when others do not. As it addresses the missing link between entrepreneurial intention and behavior from a sociopsychological approach, the main contribution of this theoretical paper is to enhance our knowledge of the entrepreneurial process, in order to improve the training and support of nascent entrepreneurs."
Bertoni Fabio,Tykvova,01/05/2015,anglais,Does governmental venture capital spur invention and innovation?,"This paper explores whether and how governmental venture capital investors (GVCs) spur invention and innovation in young biotech companies in Europe. To gauge invention we focus on the simple patent stock at the company level, while innovation is proxied by the citation-weighted patent stock. Our findings indicate that GVCs, as stand-alone investors, have no impact on invention and innovation. However, GVCs boost the impact of independent venture capital investors (IVCs) on both invention and innovation. We conclude that GVCs are an ineffective substitute, but an effective complement, of IVCs. We also distinguish between technology-oriented GVCs (TVCs) and development-oriented GVCs (DVCs). We find that DVCs are better at increasing firm’s inventions, and that TVCs, combined with IVCs, support innovations."
FARIAS Carine,,01/05/2015,anglais,"Construction, Maintenance and Dynamics of an Intentional Community","Capitalism in all its variants, and the market disconnect economic exchanges from social relations (Adler, 2001; Polanyi, 2001). As such, it has always been perceived as a potentially dangerous system, prone to systematically destroy affective links (Adler & Heckscher, 2006; Tönnies, 1988). The current phase of advanced capitalism dominated by financial logics can even result in the subjugation of life (Banerjee, 2008; Fleming, 2013a, 2013a). Emancipating from this subjugation not only requires putting capitalism in question (Adler, 2013; Parker, 2002), but also realizing collective processes of territorial (Pickerill & Chatterton, 2006), economical (Gibson- Graham, 2006), and political re-appropriation at the local level. In this sense, pre-capitalist and community-based forms of organizing, which re-socialize the economy and re-integrate it in a territory, benefit from a renewed interest (Adler, 2013; Gibson-Graham, 2006). In fact, establishing an intentional community involves a rejection of the norms established in the surrounding environment for trying out alternative social arrangements (Kanter, 1972; Pitzer, 2014). As such, it constitutes political attempts to appropriate civil society through the (re)creation of meaning, without confronting directly with the sources of power (Schehr, 1997). However, alternative organizations drifting and challenging dominant institutions necessarily face the essential challenge of being embedded in (and dependent of) the larger system while resisting it (Cheney, Cruz, Peredo, & Nazareno, 2014; Meira, 2014). Hence they are always at risk of being co-opted (Flecha & Ngai, 2014; Vieta, 2014) or caught in a process of degeneration (Cornforth, 1995). If scholars have well documented the paradoxes and tensions existing in the everyday life of alternative organizations, we still know little about the conditions under which a sustainable process of re-appropriation of economic exchanges, life and work is possible. How do people interact within these autonomous geographies, and with the larger society, so as to construct a project of collective empowerment? The present dissertation builds on an ethnographic study of Longo Maï – a European network of intentional communities created in 1973 to experiment an alternative mode of living – to explore how a group of people construct, maintain and develop a community aimed at producing collective empowerment and social innovations. This question is addressed in three parts: we first look at how the group interacts with the larger society, then focus on how they relate with each other inside their territories, and finally, we explore how production is organized in a small world of equals. It is proposed first that the neutralization of symbolic threats coming from the environment helps the group in creating an alternative culture of exchanges; second, that the use of the territory allows the group to frame specific political actions and to craft an oppositional relational structure based on friendship and hospitality; and finally, that the existence of a functional hierarchy allow them to survive as an economic unit. These aspects have been identified as essential conditions in the shaping, maintenance, and development of Longo Maï, as an enduring collective project of empowerment and social transformation. More precisely, the analysis shows that Longo Maï is continuously shaping a productive community in which economic exchanges, work and life are re-embedded in social relationships and in a territory. From this analysis, we conceptualize praxis-based form of collective empowerment facilitating the ongoing production of social innovations. Instead of relying on a strong and unified ideology, actors experiment various and fragmented practices which incorporate political beliefs. This praxis approach, associated with the crafting of a perpetual democratic dialogue, and with the nurturing of hospitable practices, facilitates the production of social innovations through the crafting of collective forms of empowerment based on a re-appropriation of life . This study contributes to ongoing discussions around the possibility of constructing sustainable community-based and value-rational organizations (Adler, 2013; Cheney et al., 2014; Gibson-Graham, 2006; Stohl & Cheney, 2001) by analyzing collective processes of enduring and empowering social transformation at the small group level (Fine, 1979; Fine & Harrington, 2004; Harrington & Fine, 2000). It can also contribute to current discussions on processes of collective empowerment (Drury & Reicher, 2005; Rao & Dutta, 2012; Vallas, 2006) leading to social innovation. More largely, this is a story of an organization facing several contradictions and striving to survive, not only in spite of them, but also with them. As such, this study can contribute to organization theory by analyzing processes through which ambiguity and disorder are accepted in daily organizational life (Robertson & Swan, 2003; Stark, 2011; Thanem, 2006), and appropriated so that to facilitate the maintenance and development of the organization.

Utilising Repertory Grid Technique, we found that the SME owner– managers’ mental models show a few commonalities as well as a number of differences across the different country samples. We interpret those differences by linking individual cognition to macro-environmental variables, such as language, national traditions and dissemination mechanisms. The results of our exploratory study show that nationality matters but that classifications of countries as found in the comparative capitalism literature do not exactly mirror national differences in CSR cognition and that these classifications need further differentiation. The findings from our study raise questions on the universality of cognition of academic management concepts and warn that promotion of responsible business practice should not rely on the use of unmediated US American management terminology."

An optimal policy for a first-mover involves splitting a discrete investment into two parts, with a first increment that positions the firm strategically and a contingent remainder that accounts for both uncertainty and simultaneous competition.

Tang Yi,Wezel,01/05/2015,anglais,Up to standard?,"The trade-off between conformity and differentiation that market entrants face has recently been enriched by a new sociological insight: differentiation is rewarded only within the confines of taken-for-granted market categories. Entrepreneurs, however, routinely engage in combining existing market categories. The present paper attempts to reconcile these seemingly different views by focusing on the role of market uncertainty. In particular, we predict that the propensity of entrants to blend multiple categories increases with market uncertainty. Upon considering the endogenous influence of uncertainty on market positioning, the positive returns obtained by entrants from combining multiple categories become apparent. Because differentiation inspires the positioning of entrants in the face of market uncertainty, the frequent adoption of the same combination by competitors dampens the performance returns derived from it. Our hypotheses find support from the analysis of a large sample of Hong Kong films during 1975–1997."

Our approach is based on the observation that the econometric structure of these systems naturally generates auxiliary equilibria that can serve as building blocks for estimation. We use this insight to develop an accurate estimator for the long-run risk model of Bansal and Yaron (2004). We demonstrate the accuracy of our method by Monte Carlo simulation and estimate the long-run risk model on U.S. data. We also illustrate the good performance of the methodology on an asset pricing model with investor learning."
DE FARIAS SHIRAISHI Guilherme,Barbosa,01/04/2015,anglais,Strategy Formulation and Organizational Structure in SMEs,"One of the biggest challenges faced by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) concerns the capacity of the entrepreneur to formulate strategies within a formal organizational structure. Very often, important knowledge about the business remains solely in the deeper levels of the entrepreneur's mind and cannot be accessed by any stakeholder. As a result, many of the good ideas that entrepreneurs have end up dying with them. This hinders business growth, business model replication, and successful succession in family businesses and SME's in general. Therefore, it is important to investigate ways to structure within the firm the strategies generated in the entrepreneur's mind, in order to prepare SMEs for growth and long-term sustainability, above and beyond the minds, hands, and lives of their founders. Our chapter explores this general theme by offering methodological insights on how to extract and formalize the tacit knowledge coming from SME founders. We focus on the formulation of strategies based on the marketing knowledge and life experience of the entrepreneur."

This is even more the case in China, where a variety of Western and Chinese market players are setting up China-specific luxury brands. Although surprising for most experts and consumers, the luxury business community in China is emerging in leaps and bounds. The main objective of this article is to analyse the major challenges and strategies for the development of luxury brands in China. For this purpose, the article discusses the concept of Chinese luxury brands and the major players and luxury start-up models. On the basis of that, success factors of Chinese luxury brands, with reference to their stage in the brand lifecycle, are analysed with eight instructive case studies including Charles Philip Shanghai, Gieves & Hawkes, NE Tiger, Seagull, Shanghai Vive, Shang xia, She Ji-Sorgere, and Sheme. Each of them represents a major luxury market entrance strategy and highlights typical success factors for luxury brand building in China, which are summarized by some major lessons learned."

We first propose an intuitive characterization of the absence of arbitrage opportunities in terms of copula functions. We then address the problem of detecting the presence of arbitrage by formalizing its resolution in two distinct ways that are both suitable for the use of optimization algorithms. The first method is valid in the general multivariate case and is based on Bernstein copulas that are dense in the set of all copula functions. The second one is easier to work with but is only valid in the bivariate case. It relies on results about improved Fréchet–Hoeffding bounds in presence of additional information. For both methods, details of implementation steps and empirical applications are provided."

Building upon a family embeddedness perspective, we develop hypotheses about curvilinear relationships between the proportion of family ties in entrepreneurs' networks and venture growth. We test them on entrepreneurs from China, France, Russia, and the United States. These effects appear to be related to the type of entrepreneurs' social network (business advice, emotional support, and business resources). Our results confirm effects specific to each network: an inverted U-shape for advice and emotional support networks but a U-shape for the business resource network, measuring what proportion of kin in each entrepreneurial network type is valuable to or, conversely, undermines new venture growth."

We begin by reclaiming the importance of bodies and embodiment in the business ethics literature, which largely assumes preeminence of the mind over the body. We then draw on French phenomenologist Michel Henry’s theory of the subjective body to advance our understanding of ethics as endogenous embodied practice rooted in life. Through the experiential realities of our ethnographic work, we show how the two interrelated dimensions in which embodiment occurs (subjective body and organic body) operate at two interrelated levels (subjective and intersubjective experience) to advance theory on the implications of corporeal ethics in organizations. More specifically, by reclaiming and specifying the ontologically embodied and shared dimensions of ethical subjectivity in life, we show the emergence and development of an esprit de corps, which allows embodying collective ethical practice while resisting to continuous external pressures."

In this paper, we analyze the effect of investors’ financial literacy on their decision to demand professional, non-independent advice. We find that non-independent advisors are not sufficient to alleviate the problem of low financial literacy. The investors with a low level of financial literacy are less likely to consult an advisor, but they delegate their portfolio choice more often or do not invest in risky assets at all. We explain this evidence with a highly stylized model of strategic interaction between investors and better informed advisors with conflicts of interests. The advisors provide more information to knowledgeable investors, who anticipating this are more likely to consult them."

Fayolle Alain,Gailly,01/01/2015,anglais,The Impact of Entrepreneurship Education on Entrepreneurial Attitudes and Intention,"Do entrepreneurship education programs (EEPs) really influence participants’ attitudes and intention toward entrepreneurship? How is this influence related to past experience and how does it persist? Researchers and entrepreneurship education stakeholders alike have been looking into this question for quite a while, with a view to validating the efficacy of such programs. The authors of this paper propose to operationalize the concept of entrepreneurial intention and its antecedents in an attempt to address those issues. In particular, we propose an original research design where (1) we measure the initial state and persistence of the impact and not only short-term effects; (2) we deal with a compulsory program, allowing to avoid self-selection biases; and (3) we deal with an homogeneous “compact” program rather than programs combining multiple teaching components whose effects cannot be disentangled. Our main research results show that the positive effects of an EEP are all the more marked when previous entrepreneurial exposure has been weak or inexistent. Conversely, for those students who had previously significantly been exposed to entrepreneurship, the results highlight significant countereffects of the EEP on those participants."

We structure our analysis on a three studies approach. The first study describes how Personal Engagement with the content and Social-Interactive Engagement (resulting from the perceived sense of community, intrinsic enjoyment and participation experience) differently influence both active and passive behavior. We test hypotheses with survey data from a sample of 814 US and EU social TV users. In study 2 we examine the influence of privacy intrusiveness on the relation between Experiential Engagement (Personal and Social-interactive Engagement) and active and passive use and we test it (n=379) with reference to mobile location-based social networking applications in EU and US. In study 3 we develop a conceptual model in which social-interactive engagement influences social identity directly and brand love indirectly through the mediating effect of social identity. The model was empirically validated (n=387) on the Facebook fan pages of 20 leading international brands in EU and the US. Findings emerging from the three studies show that Experiential Engagement has positive effects on the consumer behavior online (active and passive) and it may contrast the negative effect of privacy intrusiveness. The results obtained show also a positive effects of social-interactive engagement on consumer-brand affective relationships (brand love) and the full mediating effect of social identity. More specifically advertisers, leveraging on experiences that influence social-interactive engagement can influence the social identity and the relationship with the brand."

Cova Bernard,Pardo Salle Spencer,01/12/2014,anglais,Coping with Recurring Issues in BtoB research,"Theory would have it, according to some, that scientific disciplines follow cycles involving phases of soul-searching and radical reformulation of their scientific foundations. This article puts under scrutiny the example of the IMP Group and its evolution in this regard. On the basis of findings - including, for example, the main IMP scientific underpinnings, and an analysis of bibliometric surveys - the underlying specifics of IMP as a research community are discussed, as well as the possible future development of the community. Whilst the IMP community would seem to a large degree to escape the questioning of scientific foundations, it can be seen, however, to be questioning over time fairly systematically its identity, its modus operendi, its style, and the brand it represents, but also how these elements influence its position in today’s academic world. Indeed, in the case of IMP the building of a specific theoretical background and the progressive shaping of a research community – the social and the scientific - appear as two totally non-dissociable, intimately interlinked, phenomena. Conclusions tend towards optimism rather than what could be on the surface perceived as pessimism. The robustness and plasticity of the community’s theoretical foundations lend themselves to a “rolling stone” effect, where researchers have the latitude and possibility of proposing incremental adjustments to the framework, building and improving on it."
Crespin-Mazet Florence,Goglio-primard Lombardo,01/12/2014,anglais,Developing a usage network,"This paper explores the roles of actors in combining resources to develop an innovation network supporting the actual use of Automated External Defibrillators –AEDs- by end citizens in France. While there is growing attention devoted to innovation networks and recognition of the importance of adopting a users’ perspective to analyze innovation ventures, the role of actors in the development of resource combinations as complex solutions has been acknowledged as requiring more empirical research. This paper contributes to better understanding how technical innovations can be embedded in a using setting through interaction and development of new resource combinations in networks with a focus on the implementation stage of innovation. The paper sheds the light on new perspectives related to the configuration of innovation networks in terms of structure, coordination mechanisms and resource constellations. It suggests enlarging the perspective to a usage point of view to refer to the actual practices of appropriation (or lack of appropriation) of the innovation and to highlight the role of other value partners in this process (non users). It introduces the concept of “Usage Network” to reflect a larger perspective than the concept of users’ network. Firstly, beyond users, the Usage Network integrates a plurality of actors such as public institutions, sponsors, associations and opinion leaders coming from different business and non business arenas (public, private, individuals/professionals, experts/lay citizens…) having idiosyncratic resources enabling them to relate and interact with users. Secondly, the paper shows how the transformation of the original innovative product and its combination with the resources from those various actors take form into additional solutions, enriching it and facilitating its diffusion and adoption. The paper also provides an original insight on the coordination mechanisms of such Usage Network carried out by boundary actors which are able to create links between the AED supplier and their own network. These boundary actors coordinate the activities of its various members in their effort at combining their resources with those of the supplier: they act as “lead-value creating partners” for the supplier. The paper also highlights the variety of resource combinations required to develop the final solution both within type and across types and confirms the richness of mixed combinations in terms of value creation. This richness also comes from the plurality of the actors holding them."
Fayolle Alain,Linan Moriano,01/12/2014,anglais,Beyond entrepreneurial intentions,"The role of values and motivations in understanding the entrepreneurial cognitive process deserves closer attention. So far, the predominant approach has been studying the entrepreneurial intention. This has been a very fruitful avenue of research. However, there is still much to be known to fully understand how the decision to start a venture is formed, and how the individual acts to implement that decision. Values and motivations are closely related, since both of them are linked to the notion of goals. The higher the importance attached to a goal, the more likely the person will form action plans to achieve it. In this paper, we present some ideas on how values and motivations could be integrated into the predominant entrepreneurial intention model. Firstly, we propose that values may help to explain the formation of intention antecedents (e.g., attitudes), and also moderate their effect on the entrepreneurial intention. Secondly, we point to the possibility that values and motivations may also play a role in the intention–action link. In particular, they may be instrumental in overcoming the barriers and obstacles toward effective start-up. In addition, this paper is also an introduction to the special issue, and we present the four papers selected to be included and highlight some of the most interesting aspects of their contributions."

Dany Françoise,,01/11/2014,anglais,Time to change,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to call for an integrative approach to career research aiming to avoid both fragmentation and closure of the field through the discussion of a wide range of perspectives on career or career situations. The paper discusses the specificity of this integrative approach vs others, like the traditional approach or the multi or transdisciplinary approaches. Design/methodology/approach – The work is based on a review of the career literature, and an analytic comparison of existing research approaches across this body of literature. Findings – The paper shows the tendency of career theory to stick to narrow views of a career. The paper highlights the importance of taking into account the wide variety of career situations, which results from the fact that careers are necessarily located in time and space. The paper provides examples that invite to better explore career differences and seek for alternative explanations to career experiences. Because career dynamics are marked both by individual agency and different levels of structures, a more integrative kind of career research should thus trigger richer conversations among researchers regarding the complexity of the inhabited world. Originality/value – The specific added value of the integrative approach suggested in this paper is to open new routes for a career theory that could become stronger and enhance its power to illuminate a wide range of issues."

Data quality may affect estimations of species richness, but most broad-scale studies do not take sampling biases into account. We analysed reptile richness on islands that have received different sampling efforts, and assessed how inventory completeness affects the results of ecogeographical analyses. We also used simulations to evaluate under what circumstances insufficient sampling can bias the outcome of biodiversity analyses. Location Mediterranean islands. Methods We gathered data on reptile richness from 974 islands, assuming better sampling in islands with specific inventories. We used Moran's eigenvector mapping to analyse the factors that determine whether an island has been surveyed, and to identify the relationships between reptile richness, geographical parameters and anthropic parameters. We simulated islands, mimicking patterns of true data, and sampled them with varying effort. Simulated richness was analysed using the same approach used for real-world data. Results The probability that islands were sampled for reptiles was higher in large, human-populated islands. The relationship between human impact and reptile richness was negative in well-surveyed islands, but positive in islands that had not been systematically surveyed, because densely populated and accessible islands receive better sampling. In simulations, analyses successfully retrieved the relationships between species richness and human presence only if the average species detection probability was ≥75%. Poorer sampling resulted in biased regression results. Main conclusions Human activities may strongly affect biodiversity, but human presence and accessibility improve sampling effort and thus the quality of biodiversity information. Therefore, regressing known species richness on parameters representing human presence may result in apparent positive relationships. These two facets of human presence (positive on biodiversity knowledge, negative on actual biodiversity) represent a major challenge for ecogeographical studies, as not taking them into account would bias analyses and underestimate human impact."
Lamine Wadid,Mian Fayolle,01/11/2014,anglais,How do social skills enable nascent entrepreneurs to enact perseverance strategies in the face of challenges?,"Purpose This paper seeks to advance ongoing research in entrepreneurial perseverance. While the concept of perseverance is not new (Clark, 1935), few researchers paid attention to behavioural persistence in the entrepreneurial context. Our objective is to explore the emergence of New Technology Based Firms (NTBF) by focusing on the role of nascent entrepreneurs’ social skills in the meeting the changes of entrepreneurial perseverance. Design/methodology/approach In this paper we study the start-up phase of entrepreneurial process. We opted for a longitudinal case study approach in order to enhance our knowledge on entrepreneurs’ social skills and perseverance. For triangulation purpose the data were gathered using four different information sources. The use of Nvivo8 as the data analysis tool helped to impose a discipline and structure which facilitated the extraction of core insights. Findings This article contributes to our understanding of the entrepreneurial perseverance in the context of new venture creation. Particularly, reading the entrepreneurial process through the lens of the perseverance strategies model (Van Gelderen, 2012) provided a way to identify and then to assess the impact of the social skills on the overall entrepreneurial perseverance and their combined impact on the performance of NTBF creation process. In doing so, we identify the impact of entrepreneurs’ social skills to deal with a series of entrepreneurial problems such as scarcity of resources, uncertainty and ambiguity and consequently their impact on the likelihood of survival for new ventures. The issues that arose mostly reflected the inherent complexity of technology transfer processes, the university and entrepreneurs’ diverging cultures, and the very characteristics of the start-up phase of NTBFs. Our findings reveal how social skills impact the entrepreneurial paths and probable outcomes. Research limitations/implications This article contributes to our understanding of the entrepreneurial perseverance in the context of new technology based firm creation. Our findings reveal how social skills and perseverance impact the entrepreneurial paths and probable outcomes. Practical implications Our article has implications for entrepreneurial support mechanisms such as technology business incubators in helping them to improve the efficacy and efficiency of their assistance to entrepreneurs through the development of their skill-sets and perseverance and providing enabling networking. In addition, our research has implications for entrepreneurship education and training. Indeed, there is an urgent need to design and implement courses and programs aiming at developing soft-skills in entrepreneurship. Originality/value In exploring networking and issues of perseverance for nascent entrepreneurs operating in new technology-based sectors, which we consider as an under searched area in entrepreneurial literature"
Mirzapour Al-E-Hashem Seyed Mohammad Javad,Rekik,01/11/2014,anglais,Multi-product multi-period inventory routing problem with a transshipment option,"This paper addresses a multi-product multi-period Inventory Routing Problem (IRP) where multiple capacitated vehicles distribute products from multiple suppliers to a single plant to meet the given demand of each product over a finite planning horizon. The demand associated with each product is assumed to be deterministic and time varying. In this supply chain, the products are assumed to be ready for collection at the supplier site when the vehicle arrives. A transshipment option is considered as a possible solution to increase the performance of the supply chain and shows the impact of this solution on the environment. A green logistic issue is also incorporated into the model by considering the interrelationship between the transportation cost and the greenhouse gas emission level. The proposed model is a mixed-integer linear program and solved by CPLEX. We provide a numerical study showing the applicability of the model and underlining the impact of the transshipment option on improved supply chain performance."
TOIVONEN Aurélie,TOIVONEN,01/11/2014,anglais,The transformative effect of top management governance choices on project team identity and relationship with the organization,"This study focuses on the relationship and identity changes within and between a project team and its organization following top management intervention in the context of a large international construction project. The study follows the project-as-practice orientation, examining the actions and behaviors of the project team through participant ethnography in the “praxis” of the project site over its entire duration. The longitudinal case allows the examination of the way the transition process established a new governance culture undermining the initial trust-based one and changed it from a virtual absence of mechanisms toward far more potent mechanisms of control, monitoring, and punishment. Simultaneously, the initial stewardship relationships and collectivist identity of the project team shifted toward agency relationships and individualistic identity. The triggers for the transformation process were identiﬁed as CEO succession, project failure, top management intervention driven changes in governance mechanisms, and perception of organizational betrayal of the project team."

The authors then highlight existing gaps in the extant literature and outline a future research agenda, including key questions and issues needing additional study."
Billette de Villemeur Etienne,Ruble Versaevel,01/10/2014,anglais,Innovation and imitation incentives in dynamic duopoly,"We study entry in a growing market by ex-ante symmetric duopolists when sunk costs differ for the innovating and imitating firm. Strategic competition takes the form either of a preemption race or of a war of attrition, the latter being likelier when demand uncertainty is high. Industry value is maximized when firms seek neither to race nor to delay investment. Free imitation is socially costly, and if the consumer surplus resulting from imitation is not too large the socially optimal imitation cost, as may be induced by patent protection, involves preemption. Finally, we discuss endogenous entry barriers and contractual alternatives that increase the likelihood of preemption regimes, with differing implications for imitator entry. When the cost of imitation is low for instance, innovators are shown to rely more heavily on trade secrecy and patents. Welfare-enhancing takeovers and licensing are also shown to occur."

Grover Steven L.,Hasel Manville Serrano-Archimi,01/10/2014,anglais,Follower reactions to leader trust violations,"This paper explores how trust is violated and restored in the leader–follower relationship by analyzing rich stories in everyday trust violation situations. The results suggest a dichotomy of how violations affect trust and its propensity for repair. Recoverable violations are common occurrences from which trust can be recovered, although repeated instances of this type can destroy trust beyond recovery. The process of recovery involves leaders first openly discussing the violation(s) and then providing plans to avoid future violations. Conversely, irrecoverable trust violations destroy trust to such a degree that it cannot be restored and followers withdraw from the relationship. The study advances our understanding of trust violations by showing that recoverable violations include violations based on integrity, competence, and benevolence. Additionally, the typology of trust violations in these unique relationships promotes further investigation."
Huesler Andreas,Malevergne Sornette,01/10/2014,anglais,"Investors' expectations, management fees and the underperformance of mutual funds","Why do investors buy underperforming mutual funds? To address this issue, we develop a one-period principal-agent model with a representative investor and a fund manager in an asymmetric information framework. This model shows that the investor's perception of the fund plays a key role in the fund's fee-setting mechanism. Using a simple relation between fees and funds' performance, empirical evidence suggests that most US domestic equity mutual funds have added high markups during the period from July 2003 to March 2007. For these fees to be justified, we show that the investor would have expected the fund manager to deliver an overall annual net excess-return of around 1.5% above the S&P500 on a risk adjusted basis. In addition, our model offers a new classification of funds, based on their ability to provide benefits to investors' portfolios."
Karatas-Ozkan Mine,Anderson Fayolle Howells Condor,01/10/2014,anglais,Understanding Entrepreneurship,"Entrepreneurship is characterized by complex, dynamic and emergent processes, and the interplay between actors, processes, and contexts. Postpositivistic approaches offer the opportunity to examine subtleties of the phenomenon of entrepreneurship by placing emphasis on a range of its dimensions and the interplays between dimensions. Despite a growing body of postpositivistic research in response to such calls, the legitimacy of these approaches is still subject to debate on the grounds of rigor and relevance. This special issue challenges these prevailing but often hidden assumptions governing the conduct and publication of scholarly inquiry in the field of entrepreneurship and offers alternative perspectives for future research."

Firms that conduct innovative marketing campaigns for SPA brands, also known as fast fashion, are operating worldwide. Because SPA brands tend to have short trend cycles, corporate profitability is sensitive to consumers' attitudinal changes. The authors of this study establish a theoretical framework by examining research trends related to customer equity at home and abroad by delving into the current state of global SPA brands, defining customer equity, developing customer equity measurements, and conducting empirical analyses. This study uses structural equation models to analyze corporate marketing activity effects on customer lifetime value through brand attitude. Although earlier studies identify customer equity as driving value equity, brand equity, and relationship equity, the authors introduce social network equity as another driver."
Pardo Catherine,Ivens Wilson,01/10/2014,anglais,Differentiation and alignment in KAM implementation,"When key account management (KAM) programmes are created, they do not appear in a vacuum. Rather, they are developed in existing organizations and as a consequence the question arises of how to align the newly implemented KAM units within the host organizations. We propose using Lawrence and Lorsch's (1967a&b) differentiation concept and the concept of frame alignment (Goffman, 1974; Snow, Rochford, Worden, & Benford, 1986) to assess how much a KAM unit is actually differentiated and how to improve alignment. In a case study, we then describe the creation process of a KAM unit at Waters IS, a company specialising in water treatment. Based on a discussion of the theoretical concepts and the case situation, we suggest an approach to the assessment and management of alignment issues for KAM units."
Khader Selma,Rekik Botta-Genoulaz Campagne,01/09/2014,anglais,Inventory management subject to multiplicative inaccuracies,"The standard literature on inventory modelling is rarely differentiating between the inventory records and the physical inventory. In the recent years, some empirical studies highlighted that errors and inventory perturbations may occur in the inventory system. Such errors result in a gap between what the informational system (IS) shows and what is actually available for sales and used to satisfy the demand. The impact of such errors is particularly important in a wholesaling/e-retailing context where customer’ demands are remotely satisfied based on the inventory records shown in the IS. These errors could be modelled by an additive or multiplicative structure depending on the link between the error variability and the ordered quantity. The aim of the paper is to extend the existing literature by developing an inventory framework that permits the analysis and the performance improvement of an inventory system subject to a multiplicative errors setting. The multiplicative and stochastic settings also known as the stochastically proportional modelling of errors is not well developed in the literature despite the fact that such an assumption bears considerable association with reality. We provide comprehensive analytical and numerical studies and we also complete our contribution by a comparison between the additive and the multiplicative error settings where we derive interesting managerial insights about the impact of wrongly modelling errors. We also focus on the benefit of applying our results compared with the case where errors are ignored or not known."

This paper seeks to extend these concepts, created in the context of developed markets, into emerging and subsistence markets to identify their boundary conditions. Grounded in institutional theory, our reasoning suggests that the notions of value, price, and cost are significantly different as one moves from a developed, to an emerging, and to a subsistence market context, and that these differences do not follow a linear pattern. To reflect this institutional embeddedness, we recommend adopting different terminologies for the framework in different markets.""

We investigate differences in round size, round interval, and round syndication between new ventures that internationalize (with a fraction of revenue from abroad) and solely domestic new ventures, using longitudinal data of 962 investing rounds in 334 venture capital-backed technology companies. While opportunistic internationalizers (ratio of foreign sales to total sales less than 10%) receive less funding per round by smaller syndicates over longer intervals than domestic ventures, higher intensity strategic internationalizers receive their funding in shorter intervals."

After the definition of the multinational company, the authors present an overview of the geographic origin of MNCs and trends concerning foreign direct investments (FDI). They analyze location strategies followed by MNCs and explain the growing importance of MNCs from emerging economies. Several theoretical perspectives contribute to a better understanding of MNCs: industrial organization theory, transaction cost theory, organizational capability theory, contingency theory, business network theory and institutionalization theory. A typology of different conceptualizations (heterarchical, transnational and meta-national companies) emphasizes their heterogeneous and changing character. Recent trends highlight the increasing fragmentation of the value-chain and the development of ‘global factories’."

Vaara Eero,Junni Sarala EHRNROOTH KOVESHNIKOV,01/09/2014,anglais,Attributional Tendencies in Cultural Explanations of M&A Performance,"This paper focuses on managers’ attributions of M&A performance. Our analysis indicates that there is a linear association between performance and attributions to cultural differences, which is moderated by prior experience. Furthermore, our results suggest that there is a curvilinear association between performance and attributions to managers’ actions, but we found no support for the moderating effect of experience for this association. By substantiating these attributional tendencies, our results contribute to research on M&As and studies on attribution more generally. In particular, our study helps to put cultural differences in perspective and cautions researchers and practitioners alike to avoid simplistic explanations of M&A performance."
XU Haoxuan,Gong CHU,01/09/2014,anglais,Dynamic Lot-sizing Models with Advance Demand Information for Online Retailers,"This paper studies inventory replenishment planning problems for online retailers able to obtain advance demand information (ADI) in an environment of time-varying demands. We incorporate ADI into dynamic lot-sizing models to formulate the replenishment planning problems for online retailers in three scenarios: (1) companies act as pure-play online retailers with customers homogeneous in demand lead time, (2) online customers are heterogeneous in demand lead time with priorities, and (3) online retailers operate in a bricks and clicks structure, in which demands come from online and offline channels, with either independent or interactive channels. Based on the optimality properties, we design dynamic programming algorithms with polynomial running time to solve the model. We find a method with the computational complexity of O(NT). We conduct numerical experiments for several online retailers and find that the method can significantly reduce the total inventory cost."
Bertoni Fabio,Lugo,01/08/2014,anglais,The Effect of Sovereign Wealth Funds on the Credit Risk of their Portfolio Companies,"We study how sovereign wealth fund (SWF) investments affect the credit risk of target companies as measured by the change in their credit default swap (CDS) spreads around the investment announcement. Our analysis is based on a sample of 391 SWF investments in 198 companies between 2003 and 2010. Our results indicate that the CDS spread of target companies decreases, on average, following an SWF investment. The reduction in the CDS spread is higher when the SWF is established by a politically stable non-democratic country that has a neutral political relationship with the host country of the target company. The results are robust to different definitions of the dependent variable in terms of event window, CDS maturity and calculation of the benchmark CDS spread. Our results suggest that creditors expect SWFs to protect target companies from bankruptcy when it is in the interest of their home country to build political goodwill in the host country of the company."

HAINAUT Donatien,Le Courtois,01/08/2014,anglais,An intensity model for credit risk with switching Lévy processes,"We develop a switching regime version of the intensity model for credit risk pricing. The default event is specified by a Poisson process whose intensity is modeled by a switching Lévy process. This model presents several interesting features. First, as Lévy processes encompass numerous jump processes, our model can duplicate the sudden jumps observed in credit spreads. Also, due to the presence of jumps, probabilities do not vanish at very short maturities, contrary to models based on Brownian dynamics. Furthermore, as the parameters of the Lévy process are modulated by a hidden Markov chain, our approach is well suited to model changes of volatility trends in credit spreads, related to modifications of unobservable economic factors."
Jacquart Philippe,Antonakis,01/08/2014,anglais,Selecting Top-Level Leaders,"One stream of leadership theory suggests leaders are evaluated via inferential observer processes that compare the fit of the target to a prototype of an ideal (charismatic) leader. Attributional theories of leadership suggest that evaluations depend on knowledge of past organizational performance, which is attributed to the leader’s skills. We develop a novel theory showing how inferential and attributional processes interact to simultaneously explain top-level leader selection. We argue that observers will mostly rely on attributional mechanisms when performance signals clearly indicate good or poor performance outcomes. However, under conditions of attributional ambiguity (i.e., when performance signals are unclear), they will mostly rely on inferential processes. Using a business context and an experimental design, we show that CEO charisma and firm performance interact in predicting leader selection. The concept of attributional ambiguity has important implications for extending leadership theory in that strength of performance signals act as a “litmus test” by reducing the effect of charisma on selection decisions."
Rivera-Santos Miguel,Collectif,01/08/2014,anglais,Barriers and Opportunities at the Base of the Pyramid: The Role of the Private Sector in Inclusive Development. Report,"As part of its mandate to guide and define the role of the private sector in poverty reduction and inclusive development, the UNDP Istanbul International Center for Private Sector in Development (IICPSD) produced the “Barriers and Opportunities at the Base of the Pyramid” foundational report. Developed by an interdisciplinary team of 18 leading poverty experts, the report leverages an ecological approach to understanding barriers to poverty reduction. The report presents poverty as a complex web of accumulating and interacting disadvantages facing people living in poverty, which in turn, sustain and perpetuate a life of socioeconomic exclusion. The barriers are clustered into five broad categories: Early Developmental Barriers, Health Barriers, Skill Barriers, Social Barriers, and Decision-making Barriers. Using this framework, the IICPSD surveyed a diverse group of practitioners to understand what are some of the opportunities private sector actors can undertake to help tackle these barriers. The report clusters private sector actions into four broad approaches, each within its own commercial logic: Corporate Social Responsibility, Social Enterprise, Inclusive Business, and Mainstream Business. Through s survey of policy makers and experts, the report also discusses the role of critical enablers that can facilitate a great role for the private sector in poverty reduction and inclusive development. The report look into how the public sector, international organizations and development agencies, academia, NGOs, Innovative inclusive financing and impact investing, and technology, can catalyze further private sector action in poverty reduction. The report ends with a note that if poverty means a life of socioeconomic exclusion for people at the base of the pyramid, the solution is to preclude poverty through social inclusion—and the private sector can play a much more substantial and strategic role towards this end."
Cornelissen Joep P.,Mantere Vaara,01/07/2014,anglais,The Contraction of Meaning,"In this paper, we seek to understand how individuals, as part of a collective, commit themselves to a single, and possibly erroneous, frame, as a basis for sensemaking and coordinated actions. Using real-time data from an anti-terrorist police operation that led to the accidental shooting of an innocent civilian, we analyse how individual actors framed their circumstances in communication with one another and how this affected their subsequent interpretations and actions as events unfolded. Our analysis reveals, first, how the collective commitment to a framing of a civilian as a terrorist suicide bomber was built up and reinforced across episodes of collective sensemaking. Second, we elaborate on how the interaction between verbal communication, expressed and felt emotions, and material cues led to a contraction of meaning. This contraction stabilized and reinforced the overall framing at the exclusion of alternative interpretations. With our study we extend prior sensemaking research on environmental enactment and the escalation of commitment and elaborate on the role of emotions and materiality as part of sensemaking."
Geiler Philipp,Renneboog,01/07/2014,anglais,Executive Remuneration and the Payout Decision,"We analyze the payout channel choice of listed UK firms and examine whether the choice between dividends, share repurchases, a combination of payout channels, or complete earnings retention is affected by investor sentiment, taxation, major shareholder ownership, and in particular the CEO’s compensation package. The payout choice can have an immediate effect on the value of the CEO’s stock options and restricted stock, whereby anticipated dividends drive down the value of her equity-based pay if it is not dividend-protected whereas share repurchases may have a positive impact. We use a quantile regression analysis to examine various payout scenarios as well as a nested logit model which studies payout choice conditional on changing payout levels. We find that it is the CEO’s personal wealth as reflected by her compensation package rather than shareholder preferences which has the strongest impact on the firm’s payout policy."
Heine Klaus,Berghaus,01/07/2014,anglais,Luxury goes digital,"Today, many of the big brands are diverting substantial amounts of resources away from classical communication channels toward the digital domain. However, despite the digital gold rush, major sections of luxury brands still have not fully arrived in the digital world. Their sentiment increasingly shifts from “Do we need to be online?” to a more complicated question: “How do we actually do it right?” Therefore, this paper has two major objectives. First of all, we want to provide luxury marketers with an overview of the major digital luxury brand–consumer touchpoints and corresponding digital working areas. The first step to digital excellence is to know the available digital opportunities. Based on that, we want to derive some recommendations regarding how to tackle the digital channels successfully, based on an expert survey and a discussion of case studies for each major digital touchpoint. The paper concludes with some major lessons learned."
HERNANDEZ Monica D.,Vicdan,01/07/2014,anglais,Rethinking Flow,"The purpose of our study is twofold: (1) to conceptualize the flow construct in the offline retail environment not only as a psychological phenomenon but also as a sociocultural phenomenon by exploring related cultural variables and (2) to adopt a qualitative approach as a means to provide broader coverage of the likely factors associated with flow. We follow a grounded theory approach to formulate a conceptual model about the phenomenon of interest. Data collection includes semistructured in-depth interviews and a focus group. For data interpretation, we applied semiotic and narrative textual analyses. We propose a model of the antecedents leading to flow experience in the offline retail environment, introducing macro (sociocultural) factors and advancing micro (psychological) factors. Key elements of flow require a more refined definition in the offline retail environment. Several macro (cultural) attributes that influence Mexican shoppers' propensity to experience flow while either just browsing or fulfilling their shopping goals were identified. Retailers' efforts should be directed to providing opportunities for flow experience by articulating the right communication strategies. Qualitative methods uncovered a unique perspective exploring sociocultural characteristics and redefining individual characteristics of the offline retail shopping experience."

Cultural Processes and Causal Pathways to Inequality'","The preceding article by Lamont, Beljean and Clair (LBC) entitled ‘What is Missing? Cultural Processes and Causal Pathways to Inequality’ invites us to extend our socio-economic imagination regarding inequality. While much economic and social inequality is structural in nature, LBC discuss how the human experience of inequalities is strongly grounded in cultural process. Cultural processes here include both identification and rationalization, which LBC discuss in relation to four processes: racialization and stigmatization (for identification) and standardization and evaluation (for rationalization). While cultural processes are the contested terrain within which inequalities are shaped and played out, LBC argue why scholars should pay stronger attention to them than in previous research. Socio-Economic Review invited a group of leading scholars in the fields of inequality and cultural process to discuss the paper of LBC, and relate this both to their past work and the future of inequality research. Douglas Massey opens with a reflection on why US sociology in particular has neglected the role of culture in the study of inequality. The next two contributions by Leslie McCall and co-authors Donald Tomaskovic-Devey and Dustin Avent-Holt raise important questions about how the cultural processes described by LBC relate to the analysis of social structures, such as political discourses or the meso-level dynamics of organizations. Finally, Monin, Forgues and Wang look at how cultural processes operate in organizational settings, and use these insights to analyse the boundary conditions thereof."

Vaara Eero,,01/07/2014,anglais,Struggles over legitimacy in the Eurozone crisis,"This article focuses on the discursive underpinnings of the legitimacy crisis that the Eurozone as a transnational institution is facing. By adopting a critical discourse analysis (CDA) perspective, the empirical analysis focuses on the media discussion in Finland. The analysis shows how discourses of financial capitalism, humanism, nationalism and Europeanism played a central role in legitimation, delegitimation and relegitimation. Furthermore, the analysis elaborates on the legitimation strategies that were often used in the media texts: position-based authorizations involving institutionalized authorities and ‘voices of the common man’, knowledge-based authorizations focusing on economic expertise, rationalizations concentrating on economic arguments, moral evaluations based on unfairness used especially for delegitimation, mythopoiesis involving alternative future scenarios and cosmology used to construct inevitability. By so doing, this study adds to our understanding of the discursive and ideological underpinnings of the social, political and financial crisis in Greece and other European countries and contributes to research on discursive legitimation more generally."

Arregle Jean-Luc,Miller Hitt Beamish,01/06/2014,anglais,MNEs' Semiglobalization,"Semi-globalization emphasizes the importance of geographic regions and region-bound, firm-specific advantages in multinational enterprises’ (MNEs) internationalization process. It suggests that a MNE’s prior internationalization in a region influences its propensity to internationalize into other countries within the region. Yet, little work has explored whether this relationship might be contingent upon different components of internationalization. In this paper, we develop and test hypotheses about the moderating effects of an MNE’s internationalization patterns on semiglobalization. We develop hypotheses about MNEs’ general international experience, firm specific intangible assets, institutional diversity, cultural diversity and international asset dispersion, as moderators. The results validate the contingent effects on semiglobalization, showing that both general international experience and international geographic scope play an important role in semiglobalization. These results present a new perspective to understand how MNEs’ characteristics explain semiglobalization."
Barbieri Paolo,Dattée Lawton John Angwin,01/06/2014,anglais,The microfoundations of relational ambidexterity,"It is generally accepted within management studies that the balancing of exploration and exploitation (ambidexterity) within organizations has a positive impact on firm performance and competitiveness. However, research has shown that in networked competition the sources of competitive advantage extend beyond the firm’s boundaries to involve the strategic suppliers. This paper identifies the micro-foundations enabling the development of ambidexterity within dyadic alliances with strategic suppliers aimed at developing innovative technological solutions and components. Our results based on a multiple case study in the Lamborghini supply network show the balancing of exploratory and exploitative dyadic inter-organizational micro-routines improve project’s innovation and as well as relational rents."
Calcagno Riccardo,FALCONIERI,01/06/2014,anglais,Competition and dynamics of takeover contests,"This paper investigates the effect of potential competition on takeovers which we model as a bargaining game with alternating offers where calling an auction represents an outside option for each bidder at each stage of the game. The model describes a takeover process that is intiated by an unsolicited bidder, and it aims to answer three main questions: who wins the takeover and how? when? and how much is the takeover premium? Our results explain why the takeover premium resulting from a negotiated deal is not significantly different from that resulting from an auction, and why tender offers are rarely observed in reality. We also show that when the threat of the initial bidder to call a tender offer is not credible, the takeover process might end with a private auction organized by the target. Conversely, when the tender offer threat is credible, the takeover process ends with a deal negotiated bilaterally between the bidder and the target. The takeover premium always depends on the degree of potential competition, while it is affected by the target resistance only for weak initial bidders. Finally, the model allows us to draw conclusions on how other dimensions of the takeover process, such as termination fees, control benefits and tender offer costs, affect its dynamics and outcome."
DENOO Lien,BART Smith,01/06/2014,anglais,The Impact of Founders' Proactive Personality on Tie Strength to Acquire Startup Resources,"We investigate the impact of entrepreneurs' personality orientations on their ability to exploit the benefits of social capital. The results reported here indicate that proactive entrepreneurs are more likely to search beyond their existing networks to access cognitively distant opportunities, and to access these via weak ties. This is the case even when they already have a strong tie network. Non-proactive personality types, in contrast, are more predisposed to search close at hand and to rely upon strong network ties to access opportunities. We draw on a database of 100 new high technology entrepreneurs based in Belgium between 2006 and 2011. Our study indicates thal a focus on personality orientation offers important insights in understanding why some entrepreneurs are better able to exploit different forms of social capital than others. This work contributes to social capital research by introducing a contingency view of social capital based on entrepreneurs' personality orientation."
Larmande François,Ponssard,01/06/2014,anglais,Fishing for excuses and performance evaluation,"We study a principal–agent model in which the agent can provide ex post additional relevant information regarding his performance. In particular, he can provide a legitimate excuse, that is, evidence that a poor result is only due to factors outside his control. However, building a convincing case requires time, time that is not spent on exerting productive effort and thus generating information represents an opportunity cost. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the principal to prefer a policy of adjusting ex post the performance measure for the information provided by the agent to a policy of conforming to a result-based system with no adjustments. The risk aversion and a possible limited liability of the agent play an important role in the analysis. This paper clarifies the issues associated with the so-called “excuse culture” prevailing in some organizations."

PELTOKORPI Vesa,Vaara,01/06/2014,anglais,Knowledge transfer in multinational corporations,"This paper focuses on the multifaceted role of language and language-sensitive recruitment in knowledge transfer in multinational corporations (MNCs). In particular, we develop a framework that helps to better understand how language-sensitive recruitment is related to competence, networks, identity, and power. We started by conducting a qualitative interview-based study of 101 MNC subsidiaries. This analysis elucidates the productive and counterproductive effects of language-sensitive recruitment on knowledge transfer related to communication competence, networks, identity, and power. To further understand the productive and counterproductive effects, we conducted a quantitative study in 285 MNC subsidiaries. We found an inverted U-shaped relationship between language-sensitive recruitment and knowledge transfer. Together, these two studies provide a better understanding of the multifaceted and at times counterintuitive implications of language-sensitive recruitment on knowledge transfer in MNCs. By elucidating these effects, this paper contributes to the stream of research examining the role of language in MNCs and international business more generally. It further adds to research on MNC knowledge transfer that to date has focused little attention on language. By elaborating on the potential unintended consequences of language-sensitive recruitment, this paper also has implications for international human resource management research."
Schlierer Hans-Jörg,Seidel,01/06/2014,anglais,How to protect your License to Operate,"The purpose of this paper is to revisit the recent conceptualization of corporate legitimacy strategies in complex and heterogeneous environments by Scherer et al. (2013) through the analysis of a particular sector: the nuclear industry. As a controversial technology the whole nuclear industry is since its inception under permanent pressure to justify its “license to operate”. This impacts the strategic choices and options of any individual company operating in this industry. The literature focuses mainly on corporate strategies to gain, maintain, or defend legitimacy. In this study, we analyze the strategic responses of a company, which is perceived as definitely illegitimate in one social environment. The results of our analysis of the French nuclear giant’s Areva defense strategy in two different environments challenges many approaches and studies in legitimacy research. We argue that a long-term perspective on a business level is often more relevant than the short-term impact of an isolated incident for the legitimacy and the comprehension of response strategies of a corporation. We develop a theoretical framework for the categorization of sectorial legitimation and present an extension of the above mentioned conceptualization of corporate legitimacy strategies."
Antoniadou Elena,Mirman Ruble,01/05/2014,anglais,Lattices and Lotteries,"We consider the consumer problem under uncertainty when the consumer can choose the quantity of a risk-free good and the lottery, or distribution, of a risky good from a set of distributions. These goods are imperfect substitutes in the consumer preferences, with additive preferences a special case. We develop sufficient conditions for the choice of the risky good to be monotone with respect to income, exploring different notions of monotonicity. The sufficient conditions are ordinal, independent of concavity, and do not require differentiability or continuity. Cardinal conditions and conditions from the single good case are not necessary and are not always sufficient. The sufficient conditions are formulated in appropriate value lattices. The framework is flexible and adaptable to handle different uncertainty applications. Examples demonstrate the sufficient conditions and different applications where available lotteries may be finite in number, may have discrete support, or may form a chain or a lattice."
Barbosa Saulo,,01/05/2014,anglais,Revisiting entrepreneurship research from a decision-making perspective,"Entrepreneurship research has always been concerned with the notion of decision, either explicitly or implicitly. In this chapter I pose that, despite the richness of the field, most entrepreneurship scholars have treated the notion of decision implicitly in their work, whereas the few who treated the notion of decision explicitly focused on specific parts of the 'entrepreneurship elephant'. As a result, we are left with a fragmented body of literature that touches upon the fundamental questions of who, when, where, why, what and how, often studying one or two questions in depth, but separately. Such fragmentation is caused by specialization, which has clearly contributed to advance knowledge about entrepreneurship and facilitates our work as researchers, but makes it difficult to articulate a comprehensive view of such accumulated knowledge. In other words, while studying decision-making in entrepreneurship has to do with studying the who, when, where, why, what and how of the phenomena, doing so in a specialized manner has led our field to a fragmentation of research streams that are not well connected by any existing theoretical framework, and even less so from a decision-making perspective. In this chapter I try to articulate such an overarching framework, making an effort to revisit entrepreneurship research streams and research findings from a decision-making point of view."
Begin Lucie,Fayolle,01/05/2014,anglais,Family entrepreneurship,"For the past decades, the fields of entrepreneurship and family business research have been the object of numerous studies, regularly published and communicated at conferences and in scientific journals. While entrepreneurship and family business have been studied as two separate domains with their own dedicated research conferences and academic journals, some special issues have been devoted to studying the intersection of both concepts in an attempt to generate a third construct, that of family entrepreneurship (Poutziouris et al., 2004; Heck and Mishra, 2008; Fayolle and Bégin, 2009; Uhlaner et al., 2010). This construct seems all the more relevant since many family businesses act entrepreneurially by exploiting new opportunities (Stevenson and Jarillo, 1990; Shane and Venkataraman, 2000) or by adopting strategies and practices underpinned by risk-taking, proactiveness, innovativeness, autonomy, and competitive aggressiveness (Lumpkin and Dess, 1996). By the same token, entrepreneurship can be considered as the foundation of the family business (Chua et al., 2004), thus bridging these two interrelated constructs. Moreover, it cannot be denied that the family influences the economic and social orientations of its members (Matthews and Moser, 1995; Scott and Twomey, 1988; Kirkwood, 2007, 2009), so, we may join Rogoff and Heck (2003) in stating that family is 'the oxygen that feeds the fire of entrepreneurship'. Based on this premise, one may expect the scientific documentation on family entrepreneurship to be extensive, or at least sufficient to orient and fuel future research and to inspire practitioners and leaders."
Calcagno Riccardo,KAMADA LOVO TAKUO,01/05/2014,anglais,Asynchronicity and Coordination in Common and Opposing Interest Games,"We study games endowed with a pre-play phase in which players prepare the actions that will be implemented at a predetermined deadline. In the preparation phase, each player stochastically receives opportunities to revise her actions, and the finally-revised action is taken at the deadline. In 2-player \textquotedblleft common interest games, where there exists a best action profile for all players, this best action profile is the only equilibrium outcome of the dynamic game. In \textquotedblleft opposing interest"" games, which are $2\times 2$ games with Pareto-unranked strict Nash equilibria, the equilibrium outcome of the dynamic game is generically unique and corresponds to one of the stage-game strict Nash equilibria. Which equilibrium prevails depends on the payoff structure and on the relative frequency of the arrivals of revision opportunities for each of the players."""

Geiler Philipp,Renneboog,01/05/2014,anglais,Executive Remuneration and the Payout Decision,"We analyze the payout channel choice of listed UK firms and examine whether the choice between dividends, share repurchases, a combination of payout channels, or complete earnings retention is affected by investor sentiment, taxation, major shareholder ownership, and in particular the CEO’s compensation package. The payout choice can have an immediate effect on the value of the CEO’s stock options and restricted stock, whereby anticipated dividends drive down the value of her equity-based pay if it is not dividend-protected whereas share repurchases may have a positive impact. We use a quantile regression analysis to examine various payout scenarios as well as a nested logit model which studies payout choice conditional on changing payout levels. We find that it is the CEO’s personal wealth as reflected by her compensation package rather than shareholder preferences which has the strongest impact on the firm’s payout policy."

We explore how different socio-economic, demographic and institutional characteristics affect commercial real estate investment activity by determining both cross-sectional and time-series estimators, running augmented random effect panel regressions. We provide evidence that economic growth, rapid urbanization and compelling demographics attract real estate investment, and also demonstrate that a lack of transparency in the legal framework, administrative burdens of doing real estate business, socio-cultural challenges and political instabilities reduce international real estate allocations."
HERNANDEZ Monica D.,Vicdan,01/05/2014,anglais,Modeling word of mouth vs. media influence on videogame preorder decisions,"In order to explore the motives that drive the players to decide for preordering a videogame innovation, we opted for qualitative methods. The motives cited were pooled and scrutinized to develop categories, classifying emerging themes into intrinsic and extrinsic level factors. The most salient finding of the extrinsic side of our model revealed that the importance of the sources of information for players varies depending on the type of the innovation. For continuous innovations, consumer attributed more importance to mass media and marketer-originated information. For discontinuous innovations, consumers attributed more importance to interpersonal sources, which included friends and online reviews. We expect that the identified issues and proposed model may guide for future research in the preordering phenomenon."
KALASIN Kiattichai,Dussauge Rivera-Santos,01/05/2014,anglais,The Expansion of Emerging Economy Firms into Advanced Markets,"Existing literature has investigated the drivers behind the expansion of emerging market firms into other emerging markets, but we are only beginning to understand how emerging market firms expand into more advanced markets. Grounding our arguments in institutional theory and the notions of managerial intentionality and path-breaking strategies, we argue that emerging market firms can intentionally pursue path-breaking changes that set them on an organizational path better suited to advanced market conditions, by listing their stock on advanced financial markets or divesting unrelated business. We test our arguments on a sample of 855 emerging market firms from 18 countries over a six-year period. Our results strongly support our argument that emerging market firms can intentionally change their organizational paths and develop the ability to expand into advanced markets."
MIKKONEN Ilona,Vicdan MARKKULA,01/05/2014,anglais,What Not to Wear?,"In this paper, we draw attention to the emancipatory premises of oppositional ideologies and the ideological nature of consumption in the context of fashion. Drawing on the Foucauldian concept of power, we illustrate how a specific genre of self-help literature, which we have termed wardrobe self-help (WSH), produces an alternative mode of discourse about fashion and clothing as a cultural mediator. Our findings challenge the prevailing fashion ideology that capitalizes on emancipation, and unravel the means through which WSH oppositional ideology governs consumers. Consequently, we argue that while oppositional ideologies can blur the boundaries between coercion and consent, and act as vehicles of repression and liberation, they ultimately come to govern, if not limit, consumer choice and expression."
Neri Cassio,Schneider,01/05/2014,anglais,The Impact of the Prior Density on a Minimum Relative Entropy Density,"We study the problem of finding probability densities that match given European call option prices. To allow prior information about such a density to be taken into account, we generalise the algorithm presented in Neri and Schneider (Appl. Math. Finance 2013) to find the maximum entropy density of an asset price to the relative entropy case. This is applied to study the impact of the choice of prior density in two market scenarios. In the first scenario, call option prices are prescribed at only a small number of strikes, and we see that the choice of prior, or indeed its omission, yields notably different densities. The second scenario is given by CBOE option price data for S&P500 index options at a large number of strikes. Prior information is now considered to be given by calibrated Heston, Schöbel–Zhu or Variance Gamma models. We find that the resulting digital option prices are essentially the same as those given by the (non-relative) Buchen–Kelly density itself. In other words, in a sufficiently liquid market, the influence of the prior density seems to vanish almost completely. Finally, we study variance swaps and derive a simple formula relating the fair variance swap rate to entropy. Then we show, again, that the prior loses its influence on the fair variance swap rate as the number of strikes increases."
Ruble Richard,,01/05/2014,anglais,Buyer and seller power in vertical structures,"This paper develops a model of exchange between a single buyer and seller with simultaneous non-cooperative choices of a mark-up and a mark-down. These choices arise as optimal responses to uncertainty, if strategic and sales decisions are separate functions within the firm. There are multiple Pareto-ranked equilibria. In an interior equilibrium the amount traded equates marginal expenditure and marginal revenue, and the market power of each party depends on the relative slope of marginal value and marginal cost. If unit production cost is constant, the outcome is the same as in the Spengler-Stackelberg analysis of vertically related rms, whose assumption of upstream market power is thereby rationalized."
Vernuccio Maria,Pagani Barbarossa Pastore,01/05/2014,anglais,The Role of Social-Interactive Engagement and Social Identity in The Development of Brand Love Through Facebook Fan Page,"The marketing literature has drawn increasing attention to the consumer-brand affective relationship-building process, experiential engagement and self-definitional issues within online network-based communities. However, research attempting to develop an integrative perspective of experiential engagement and social identity theory is still fairly scant. Integrating social identity theory with the experiential engagement and brand love literatures, this paper proposes a social identity approach to consumer-brand affective relationships in online network-based communities. Specifically, this study develops a conceptual model in which social-interactive engagement influences social identity directly and brand love indirectly through the mediating effect of social identity. The model was empirically validated by conducting a survey (n=387) on the Facebook fan pages of 20 leading international brands based primarily in Europe and the US. Structural equation modelling was performed to assess the significance of the hypothesised linkages. The results obtained confirm the positive effects of social-interactive engagement and social identity on consumer-brand affective relationships in terms of brand love and the full mediating effect of social identity on social-interactive engagement and brand love. Implications for consumers and marketers are finally addressed."
Younes Dima,,01/05/2014,anglais,Professionals' Resistance or Scientists' Art of Renegotiating the Value of R&D Projects,"Companies gather professionals such as scientists or lawyers who are trapped in a tension between organizational goals and professional expectations. Individuals have then to permanently decide whether to follow their managers’ policies or their peers’ ethos. The question is then to know what form their resistance takes when they decide to rebel organizational goals and how this influences organizations. This paper attempts to answer this question through the study of forms of resistance mobilized by scientists in business firms and their consequences. It relies on two case studies where scientists challenge top managers’ evaluation of a research project they have to or want to work on. The paper argues that although professionals resist in practice in the same way other employees do, Top Managers cannot judge whether this is resistance or not. This is the case because Scientists can use their expertise to make Top Managers believe that results are due to the characteristics of projects. This form of “undetectable” resistance works when there is team solidarity, making a “counter-expertise” impossible to get. At the end, the paper shows that professionals attempt to influence categories of judging worth in their organizations in a sustainable way.Third, the paper shows that professional resistance can target something other than meaning or policies. Indeed, they can target the way projects are evaluated in the firm by influencing the perimeter of categories mobilized in the decision making process."

We find that overall, LBO companies do not exhibit lower innovation and R&D investments than non-LBO companies during the crisis, with other things being equal. However, innovation and R&D investments decline substantially in LBO companies that were financially constrained before the deal.

We show that, as soon there is a positive bequest motive, sufficiently risk averse individuals should not purchase annuities. A model calibration accounting for lifetime risk aversion generates a significantly smaller willingness-to-pay for annuities than the one generated by a standard time-additive model. Moreover, the calibration predicts that riskless savings finance one third of consumption, in line with empirical findings."

We argue that location advantage can be best understood as the result of the interaction between two distinct types of co-evolutionary processes: emergent, whereby location advantage is created as the result of agglomeration dynamics in product and factor markets; and guided, whereby location advantage is created as the result of infrastructure dynamics in institutions and endowments. We illustrate empirically the application of the co-evolutionary perspective and the differences between emergent and guided co-evolutionary processes with the analysis of the development of location advantage in the Costa Rican tourism industry."

Le Courtois Olivier,,01/04/2014,anglais,The Tempered Multistable Approach and Asset Return Modeling,"Typical approaches incorporating jumps in financial dynamics, such as the Variance Gamma and CGMY models, can be made to depart from the i.i.d. hypothesis by using a stochastic clock. In such a context, the introduction of a dispersion of the clock is equivalent to the introduction of a dispersion of the volatility itself. A distinct route that yields comparable features is that of adding a jump component to a stochastic volatility process, or of considering, in discrete time, leptokurtic innovations within a GARCH process. In this article, we take a third route and we provide a study on tempered multistable processes, which convey both jumps and autocorrelation from their very construction, and on some of their applications in finance. We obtain the multivariate characteristic function of the asymmetrical field-based tempered multistable process and we study the autocorrelations that stem from the use of this model. We concentrate on three types of applications in finance: we study the term structures of Value-at-Risk that can be obtained with this model, we perform a calibration on stock index data, and we also conduct a calibration on derivatives prices."

New value propositions and revenue opportunities based on digital capabilities are emerging in the digital broadcasting industry. This study lies at the intersection of the intellectual domains of strategic management and organizational. It aims to contribute to fundamental debate in these fields exploring the business model transitions following the emergence of an incremental innovation and cross industry disruptions. We used both primary and secondary data sources for this study. Longitudinal data were collected on a sample of 792 firms across the supply chain of broadcasting industry in the Us and Europe between 1996 and 2008. Findings show three main business models transitions a from a focus on the design of information systems, to the design of Itenabled business processes, and more recently to the design of business models for services provided through digital platforms."

Bertoni Fabio,MEOLI VISMARA,01/03/2014,anglais,"Board Independence, Ownership Structure and the Valuation of IPOs in Continental Europe","Research Question/Issue We combine the value-creation and value-protection views of the board of directors to study the impact of board independence (BI) on the value of the firm at the time of its initial public offering (IPO). Research Findings/Insights We conduct our analysis on a sample of 969 firms that went public in France, Germany, and Italy between 1995 and 2011. We show that BI is a critical factor in the valuation of IPO firms. Our results support both the value-creation and value-protection roles of the board of directors. The relative importance of the two roles of the board varies over time, with value-creation (value-protection) dominating in IPOs of young (mature) companies. Theoretical/Academic Implications Our theoretical framework combines the agency and resource-dependence theories. The impact of BI on IPO valuation depends on the importance of the value-creation and value-protection roles played by the board. The change in the relative importance of the two roles determines a U-shaped relationship between BI and firm age. Corporate governance is particularly important for young and innovative firms (where the resource-dependence theory applies, and governance acts as a value-creation device), as well as for mature firms and for companies where ownership and control are separated (where the agency theory applies, and governance serves as a value-protection mechanism for minority shareholders). Practitioner/Policy Implications We show that corporate governance is a significant factor affecting the valuation of an IPO company. The importance of BI varies substantially with the knowledge intensity of the industry, the separation between ownership and control, and the age of the listing company."
Bertoni Fabio,Groh,01/03/2014,anglais,Cross-Border Investments and Venture Capital Exits in Europe,"Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: We examine the way in which the exit mode (i.e., initial public offering – IPO, trade sale, or write-off) of venture capital (VC) investments is influenced by the additional exit opportunities brought by cross-border VC investors. Research Findings/Insights: We perform our analysis on a sample of 1,062 VC investments in 462 young high-tech companies in seven European countries. Our findings indicate that, controlling for firm performance, investor characteristics, and local exit conditions, the probability of exiting via trade sale is positively correlated to the additional set of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) opportunities brought by cross-border investors. A similar effect, but with weaker statistical significance, is also identified for exits by IPO, which are positively affected by IPO volumes in the countries of cross-border investors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Cross-border VC investment may, at least partially, compensate for inadequate local exit conditions. Cross-border investors can spillover the capital market activity of their home country and enhance exit options for young ventures. International syndicates are also quicker to write off their non-performing investments. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Not all exit modes are equally affected by international syndication. The impact of cross-border investors on the exit mode also depends on their country of origin and, more specifically, on the exit opportunities available there. The mechanism is stronger for trade sales than for IPOs."
Bertoni Fabio,Lugo,01/03/2014,anglais,The Effect of Sovereign Wealth Funds on the Credit Risk of Their Portfolio Companies,"We study how sovereign wealth fund (SWF) investments affect the credit risk of target companies as measured by the change in their credit default swap (CDS) spreads around the investment announcement. Our analysis is based on a sample of 391 SWF investments in 198 companies between 2003 and 2010. Our results indicate that the CDS spread of target companies decreases, on average, following an SWF investment. The reduction in the CDS spread is higher when the SWF is established by a politically stable non-democratic country that has a neutral political relationship with the host country of the target company. The results are robust to different definitions of the dependent variable in terms of event window, CDS maturity and calculation of the benchmark CDS spread. Our results suggest that creditors expect SWFs to protect target companies from bankruptcy when it is in the interest of their home country to build political goodwill in the host country of the company."
Billette de Villemeur Etienne,Ruble Versaevel,01/03/2014,anglais,Investment Timing and Vertical Relationships,"We show that the standard analysis of vertical relationships transposes directly to investment dynamics. Thus, when a ﬁrm undertaking a project requires an outside supplier (e.g., an equipment manufacturer) to provide it with a discrete input to serve a growing but uncertain demand, and if the supplier has market power, investment occurs too late from an industry standpoint. The distortion in ﬁrm decisions is characterized by a Lerner-type index. Despite the underlying investment option, greater volatility can result in a lower value for both ﬁrms. We examine several contractual alternatives to induce eﬃcient timing, a novel vertical restraint being for the upstream to sell a call option on the input. We also extend the model to allow for downstream duopoly. When downstream ﬁrms are engaged in a preemption race, the upstream ﬁrm sells the input to the ﬁrst investor at a discount such that the race to preempt exactly oﬀsets the vertical distortion, and this leader invests at the optimal time. These results are illustrated with a case study drawn from the pharmaceutical industry."

We find that households with higher levels of financial literacy hold a relatively lower share of illiquid wealth, and the results are more pronounced at older ages, when according to the lifecycle hypothesis they are meant to decumulate their assets. Results appear robust to different specifications of the dependent variable and potential endogeneity of financial literacy."

We also show that the gender pay gap is lower for executives in firms with female non-executives. Female executives in ‘male’ industries face a smaller pay gap. The advice of top remuneration consultants does not reduce the pay gap for executive directors (excluding the CEO). We also find that the pay gap increases when accounting for marriage and parenthood."
GHOSH Anindya,MARTIN Pennings Wezel,01/03/2014,anglais,Ambition Is Nothing Without Focus,"Organizations create high-impact inventions when they combine disparate strands of technology in their corporate research and development. We theorize that when undertaking complex inventive search characterized by high breadth, i.e., drawing on multiple diverse technology components, an organization’s propensity toward high-impact inventions depends on its stock of experience with recombining such components and on the focus of its inventive search. Building on learning transfer theory, we argue that the complexity and causal ambiguity of higher-breadth projects is such that experience with similar inventive search will be a poorer guide, comparatively reducing their inventive impact; however, this negative effect can be attenuated by the degree of focus of an organization’s contemporaneous inventive search. Using a longitudinal data set of patents from the photographic imaging industry, we find support for our predictions."
Le Courtois Olivier,Walter,01/03/2014,anglais,Extreme Financial Risks and Asset Allocation,"Each financial crisis calls for — by its novelty and the mechanisms it shares with preceding crises — appropriate means to analyze financial risks. In Extreme Financial Risks and Asset Allocation, the authors present in an accessible and timely manner the concepts, methods, and techniques that are essential for an understanding of these risks in an environment where asset prices are subject to sudden, rough, and unpredictable changes. These phenomena, mathematically known as “jumps”, play an important role in practice. Their quantitative treatment is generally tricky and is sparsely tackled in similar books. One of the main appeals of this book lies in its approachable and concise presentation of the ad hoc mathematical tools without sacrificing the necessary rigor and precision. This book contains theories and methods which are usually found in highly technical mathematics books or in scattered, often very recent, research articles. It is a remarkable pedagogical work that makes these difficult results accessible to a large readership. Researchers, Masters and PhD students, and financial engineers alike will find this book highly useful."
Ruble Richard,Versaevel,01/03/2014,anglais,"Market shares, R&D agreements, and the EU block exemption","Regulation (EC) No 1217/2010 on the application of Article 101(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to categories of R&D agreements exempts horizontal R&D agreements from antitrust concerns when the combined market share of participants is low enough. We examine the theoretical basis for this criterion by extending existing models so that a subset of firms innovates and participates in an R&D cooperation agreement. We show that the incentive to increase innovation depends on a complex set of effects. We identify one, the outsider effect, that can lead firms to increase R&D under cooperation precisely when their combined market share is high. In a general model in which all firms innovate, we also find that R&D agreements can be more beneficial at higher market shares. We argue that existing theory therefore does not support limiting the exemption to low market shares."
Schneider Lorenz,,01/03/2014,anglais,Firm value in emerging network industries,"This paper examines emerging industries that exhibit positive network effects. We put forward a dynamic model in which two technologies compete to be the standard. The model provides a quantitative method for the valuation of firms. We use the model to examine the relationship between network effects, consumer heterogeneity, and prices. We show that the firm value depends strongly on the particular choice of the network strength function. We compare three types of such functions, identify shortcomings of traditionally used ones, and propose a more realistic one."
Vaara Eero,Balogun JACOB,01/03/2014,anglais,Placing Strategy Discourse in Context,"There has been increasing interest in the discursive aspects of strategy over the last two decades. In this paper we review the existing literature, focusing on six major bodies of discursive scholarship: post-structural, critical discourse analysis, narrative, rhetoric, conversation analysis, and metaphor. Our review reveals the significant contributions of research on strategy and discourse, but also the potential to advance research in this area by bringing together research on discursive practices and research on other practices we know to be important in strategy work. We explore the potential of discursive scholarship in integrating between significant theoretical domains (sensemaking, power, and sociomateriality), and realms of analysis (institutional, organizational, and the episodic), relevant to strategy scholarship. This allows us to place the papers published in this special issue on Strategy as Discourse: Its Significance, Challenges, and Future Directions among the body of knowledge accumulated thus far, and to suggest a way forward for future scholarship."
Bertoni Fabio,GIUDICI,01/02/2014,anglais,The Strategic Reallocation of IPO shares,"In this work, we study the reallocation of shares to retail and institutional investors, measured as the difference between the allocation declared before the initial public offering (IPO) and the effective allotment decided by the underwriter after the bookbuilding process. The reallocation is disaggregated into three components, two of which are under the direct control of the underwriter: the initial allocation, and the demand satisfaction ratio. The empirical analysis is based on a sample of 193 hybrid IPOs issued in Italy between 1997 and 2012. Controlling for firm and IPO characteristics, we find that the IPO shares are typically shifted toward institutional investors when positive information is collected during the bookbuilding process. The IPO pricing and share reallocation are found to be interdependent, and reallocation is used in combination with partial adjustment to reward institutional investors."
Fayolle Alain,Redford,01/01/2014,anglais,Handbook On The Entrepreneurial University,"This insightful Handbook offers a lens through which to view entrepreneurship strategy for higher education institutions, as it becomes increasingly necessary for universities to consider changing their strategies, culture and practices to become more entrepreneurial. Is the idea of an entrepreneurial university a myth or a reality? Is the university model capable of adapting to new evolving trends and a more complex professional world? And, what is the impact of entrepreneurship in education? Through extensive research and case studies from some of the leading entrepreneurial thinkers around the world, Alain Fayolle and Dana Redford answer these questions and raise further issues for debate. Particular focus is given to developing university strategy, public policy and start-up support as a means to foster graduate entrepreneurship. Each contribution explores different perspectives related to the entrepreneurial university concept and its role in stimulating economic growth through cooperative relationships with business and government. As a comprehensive study of the entrepreneurial university, this Handbook will prove invaluable to business and entrepreneurship students and academics, as well as university administrators, researchers and others interested in the evolution of the university."

This essential guide to publishing in entrepreneurship brings together a wealth of contributors, all of whom have published in the leading entrepreneurship journals. Based on their experiences as researchers and editors, they bring useful hands-on advice and insight into the research publication process. Both fledgling and experienced entrepreneurship faculty members will find this an essential resource as they strive towards publication in A-ranked entrepreneurship or management journals."

Wassmer Ulrich,CUETO SWITZER,01/01/2014,anglais,The effect of corporate environmental initiatives on firm value,"When do firms derive value from investing in environmental initiatives (CEIs)? We examine stock market responses to the announcements of 183 CEIs by 71 Fortune 500 firms during the period 2002 to 2008. We find that the stock market reacts positively to such announcements but does not react differently to CEIs concerning a firm’s inputs, throughputs, and outputs. We also find that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between the timing of a CEI and the abnormal stock market return following its announcement. Overall, this study shows that timing is a relevant explanatory factor for the value firms derive from investing in environmental action."
Belhoste Nathalie,Monin,01/12/2013,anglais,Constructing differences in a cross-cultural context,"This article develops theory about the perspectives through which expatriate managers and their employees socially construct differences in a cross-cultural context. On the basis of qualitative research on three kinds of organizations – multinational corporations, small and medium-sized enterprises and start-up companies – we identify three perspectives on differences in a cross-cultural context: the national distance perspective, the social differentiation perspective and the functional distinction perspective. Each perspective relates to a specific basis for categorization (nationality, status and function), focus of attention (values, attitudes and expertise) and definition of diversity (separation, disparity and variety). We find that international experience and country experience on one side, and the purpose of business (business development, business creation or business turnaround) on the other side, explain why some expatriate managers and their employees adopt one perspective or another, sometimes as default. The passing of time, as reflected in growing country experience, growing work experience and growing company tenure, can be the motor of transition from one perspective to another. Our findings contribute to cross-cultural and diversity studies, to social constructionism, and have consequences for international human resource management research and practices."
CAMBLANNE Lionel,,01/12/2013,anglais,Family vision and cognition,"Based on cognition as a key determinant in strategic decisions, this study employs a case study approach to explore how family vision – one of the main characteristics of family firms – affects the cognitive frames of reference of family decision-makers, especially business owners. This research suggests that family business owners pursue different family visions, which leads to different interpretations of environmental information during strategic decision-making by highlighting certain elements. I infer several propositions outlining that the degree of a family vision's emphasis on non-economic goals may modify the framing of decisions and endanger long-term orientation, therefore affecting strategic outcomes."
Heine Klaus,NOBBS SPERBER,01/12/2013,anglais,Creating and developing luxury brands in China,"The luxury business community in China is already rapidly emerging with many Chinese business people dreaming about creating their own Chinese luxury brand, not only to make money, but also because of their strong fascination of luxury and even to bring pride to their company and country. The main objective of this case collection is to analyse the major challenges and strategies for the creation and development of luxury brands in China with reference also to their stage in the brand lifecycle. The collection covers eight very diverse and especially instructive case studies including Charles Philip Shanghai, Gieves & Hawkes / Trinity, NE TIGER, Seagull, Shanghai VIVE, Shang Xia, She Ji-Sorgere, and Sheme. Each of them represents a major luxury market entrance strategy and highlights typical success factors for luxury brand building in China. The cases allow for the discussion of many essential luxury branding strategies including identity-driven brand management, brand revival, brand revitalisation and brand stretching / extension. Case materials contain extensive teaching notes also including MS PowerPoint charts with all pictures used in the case studies and many additional examples and figures explaining major success factors and luxury branding strategies."
Heine Klaus,,01/12/2013,anglais,Opportunities for luxury entrepreneurship in China,"In this article, Klaus Heine, Professor of Luxury Management at EMLYON Business School discusses new opportunities for entrepreneurs in the luxury segment. Major drivers for luxury entrepreneurship include the changing consumer preferences in China for example, which is a representative model for many other emerging economies, and the growing concerns of the sustainability movement. Professor Klaus Heine argues that the global successes of luxury brands jeopardize their future successes, thereby creating opportunities for entrepreneurs worldwide."
Korine Harry,Gomez,01/12/2013,anglais,"Strong Managers, Strong Owners","The family firm preparing generational change, the partnership that welcomes new partners, and the shareholders of a firm that chooses to go public are making decisions that will have an impact on strategy and management. Conversely, a change in strategy such as a move to diversify or a decision to take on more risk in a business can make the firm more attractive to some shareholders and less attractive to others and is therefore not ownership neutral. Opening the black box of agency theory, Korine and Gomez show how management and ownership interact to shape the strategy of the firm. In their view, the critical question to ask is not what is the best strategy, but rather, who is the strategy for? With numerous detailed examples, Strong Managers, Strong Owners is an invaluable resource for company owners, board members and executives, as well as their advisors in strategy and governance."
Neri Cassio,Schneider,01/12/2013,anglais,A Family of Maximum Entropy Densities Matching Call Option Prices,"We investigate the position of the Buchen–Kelly density (Peter W. Buchen and Michael Kelly. The maximum entropy distribution of an asset inferred from option prices. Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 31(1), 143–159, March 1996.) in the family of entropy maximizing densities from Neri and Schneider (Maximum entropy distributions inferred from option portfolios on an asset. Finance and Stochastics, 16(2), 293–318, April 2012.), which all match European call option prices for a given maturity observed in the market. Using the Legendre transform, which links the entropy function and the cumulant generating function, we show that it is both the unique continuous density in this family and the one with the greatest entropy. We present a fast root-finding algorithm that can be used to calculate the Buchen–Kelly density and give upper boundaries for three different discrepancies that can be used as convergence criteria. Given the call prices, arbitrage-free digital prices at the same strikes can only move within upper and lower boundaries given by left and right call spreads. As the number of call prices increases, these bounds become tighter, and we give two examples where the densities converge to the Buchen–Kelly density in the sense of relative entropy. The method presented here can also be used to interpolate between call option prices, and we compare it to a method proposed by Kahalé (An arbitrage-free interpolation of volatilities. Risk, 17(5), 102–106, May 2004). Orozco Rodriguez and Santosa (Estimation of asset distributions from option prices: Analysis and regularization. SIAM Journal on Financial Mathematics, 3(1), 374–401, 2012.) have produced examples in which the Buchen–Kelly algorithm becomes numerically unstable, and we use these as test cases to show that the algorithm given here remains stable and leads to good results."
Phan Michel,Heine,01/12/2013,anglais,SHANG XIA: the journey of a Chinese luxury brand,"Shang Xia (means 'Up' and 'Down' in mandarin) is a Chinese luxury brand that was born from a chance encounter between Ms Jiang Qiong Er, a Chinese designer with a double understanding of the French and Chinese cultures, and Mr Patrick Thomas, CEO of Hermes, a French group known for their exquisite silk scarves and supple leather bags such as the 'Kelly' and the 'Birkin' handbags. The journey of Shang Xia started in 2008 with a clear mission to create a new Chinese luxury brand that will be well rooted in the 5,000-year old and rich history of China. Ms Jiang Qiong Er dreamt about creating such a brand for a very long time and saw her dream come true thanks to the generous financial support from the Hermes group. Naturally she became the CEO of Shang Xia and also the Creative Director. The company opened its first store in 2010 in Shanghai. At that time, the event was such a novelty for the luxury industry that it attracted worldwide attention, and the media quickly relayed the news. Shang Xia products range from homewares such as tea sets and porcelain bowls, to furniture and ready-to-wear. It is a lifestyle brand that offers products that are carefully crafted from the finest and best raw materials with traditional techniques and a modern twist. The brand is still very young but it already has a solid foundation and a nice, very credible story to tell. Will it become the new 'Chinese Hermes'? With such parents and brand DNA, it is only a matter of time that it will happen! This case study presents in details the development of Shang Xia since its inception and includes teaching notes that discuss strategies for developing a new luxury brand."
ARMSTRONG J. Scott,Jacquart,01/11/2013,anglais,The Ombudsman: Is the Evidence Sufficient to Take Action on Executive Pay?,The experimental evidence in this collection of papers is sufficient for organizations to take action—at least with respect to investigating or testing alternative pay schemes. Some organizations have already implemented a number of these procedures. The failure of an organization’s directors to follow evidence-based procedures for executive pay might be used as a basis for legal action by shareholders when results are detrimental to a firm.
CHALLE Edouard,Le Grand Ragot,01/11/2013,anglais,"Incomplete markets, liquidation risk, and the term structure of interest rates","We analyse the term structure of interest rates in a general equilibrium model with incomplete markets, borrowing constraint, and positive net supply of government bonds. Uninsured idiosyncratic shocks generate bond trades, while aggregate shocks cause fluctuations in the trading price of bonds. Long bonds command a “liquidation risk premium” over short bonds, because they may have to be liquidated before maturity – following a bad idiosyncratic shock – precisely when their resale value is low – due to the simultaneous occurrence of a bad aggregate shock. Our framework endogenously generates limited cross-sectional wealth heterogeneity among the agents (despite the presence of uninsured idiosyncratic shocks), which allows us to characterise analytically the shape of the entire yield curve, including the yields on bonds of arbitrarily long maturities. Agentsʼ desire to hedge the idiosyncratic risk together with their fear of having to liquidate long bonds at unfavourable terms implies that a greater bond supply raises the level of the yield curve, while an increase in the relative supply of long bonds raises its slope."
Forgues Bernard,LIARTE,01/11/2013,anglais,Academic Publishing,"In this essay, we reflect on how the results of scholarly research are diffused. We first give an overview of the current state of academic publishing, noting the issues of subscription prices and time embargoes. We then discuss how the “open access” movement responds to these issues and how it aims at reshaping the field. Finally, we illustrate our points with a discussion of the history of M@n@gement, which has been a pioneer in open access publishing."
Jacquart Philippe,ARMSTRONG,01/11/2013,anglais,The Ombudsman: Are Top Executives Paid Enough?,"Our review of the evidence found that the notion that higher pay leads to the selection of better executives is undermined by the prevalence of poor recruiting methods. Moreover, higher pay fails to promote better performance. Instead, it undermines the intrinsic motivation of executives, inhibits their learning, leads them to ignore other stakeholders, and discourages them from considering the long-term effects of their decisions on stakeholders. Relating incentive payments to executives’ actions in an effective manner is not possible. Incentives also encourage unethical behavior. Organizations would benefit from using validated methods to hire top executives, reducing compensation, eliminating incentive plans, and strengthening stockholder governance related to the hiring and compensation of executives."
Larmande François,,01/11/2013,anglais,Voluntary ambiguity in incentive contracts,"Because accounting standards allow for some discretion in their application, accounting numbers often result from the choice of one possible interpretation among several. This paper investigates the optimal choice of a principal when this information is used for stewardship: whether committing ex-ante to using one specific interpretation, the more informative one, or keeping the ambiguity and opportunistically choosing ex-post the performance measure the least favorable to the agent. The choice between ambiguity and commitment involves a trade-off between the potential windfall for the agent (higher with commitment) and the risk of undeserved punishment (higher with ambiguity). The optimal policy depends on the risk aversion of the agent and of the extent of the ambiguity: high risk aversion and a large number of interpretations being in favor of ex-ante commitment."
Picard Sébastien,Perezts Steyer Philippe,01/11/2013,anglais,Orchestrating complexity,"This proposal considers one of the key challenges of complex organizational settings and environments for strategy-making. When strategic decisions must be made, the question of how to orchestrate multiple, intertwined, and often conflicting logics, or action nets Czarniawka (2004, 2006, 2010), underlying firms’ competitiveness remains crucial. In this research, we argue that the ability of complex firms to develop a concrete way to effectively “muddle through” such situations, instead of working against conflicting logics, denying them or submitting to choice, is vital for their success. An in-depth case study of a European Global Biotech Firm in the vaccine industry – characterized by a number of sensitive strategic implications – provides the empirical grounding to explore the micro-foundations of this orchestration capability defined as the ability to enact coherence between multiple logics."
Alperovych Yan,Hubner,01/10/2013,anglais,Incremental impact of venture capital financing,"This paper investigates the differences in the return generating process of venture capital (VC)-backed firms and their peers that operate without VC financing. Using a unique hand-picked database of 990 VC-backed Belgian firms and a complete population of Belgian small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), we focus on the extent to which the presence of a VC investor affects the sensitivity of a firm’s returns to the changes in the capital structure, in the operating cycle, and in the industry dynamics. The differences may stem from the (self-) selection of better companies into VC portfolios, from the venture capitalists’ (VCs) value-adding activities, and/or from both. We examine these factors in the context of a complex simulation procedure which allows separating selection from value-adding when traditional approaches are difficult to implement. Our results indicate that VC-backed firms are able to extract more rent from the changing industry conditions and from the optimizations in their capital structure. The presence of VCs in the firm’s equity seems to have only a marginal effect on the operating cycle efficiency. Overall, the results are suggestive of the value-adding being the main driver of the VC-backed firm’s performance."
Anand Mohit,Monin,01/10/2013,anglais,Innovation Processes in Emerging Markets,"How do organizations innovate to respond to emerging market issues? Building on a multiple-case research design, we study four cases of innovation in the Indian insuranceindustry. In the first stage of our analysis, we identify seven innovation processes: Demystification, technologization, bundlization, indigenization, retailization, commoditization and segmentation. In the second stage, we find that these seven processes serve as generic responses to three typical issues: management of meanings and values, accessibility and affordability that firms face in emerging markets. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of innovation processes in emerging markets."
Dequiedt Vianney,Versaevel,01/10/2013,anglais,Patent pools and dynamic R&D incentives,"Patent pools are cooperative agreements between two or more firms to license their related patents as a bundle. In a continuous-time model of multistage innovations, we characterize firms’ incentives to perform R&D when they anticipate the possibility of starting a pool of complementary patents, which can be essential or nonessential. A coalition formation protocol leads the first innovators to start the pool immediately after they patent the essential technologies. The firms invest more than in the no-pool case and increase the speed of R&D for essential technologies as the number of patents progresses to the anticipated endogenous pool size, to the benefit of consumers. There is overinvestment in R&D compared to a joint profit-maximization benchmark. If firms anticipate the addition of nonessential patents to the pool they reduce their R&D efforts for the essential patents at each point in time, resulting in a slower time to market for the pooled technologies."
Forgues Bernard,Thiétart,01/10/2013,anglais,Chaos theory,"Firms can be described as non-linear dynamic systems in that they are home to counteracting forces simultaneously at play. As a consequence, firms or some of their processes can enter a chaotic state. In such a state prediction is impossible, especially at a global scale and in the long run. Closure is still possible as firms may be attracted towards specific configurations. Finally, because contextual conditions are never the same, no similar actions can yield the same result."
Hasel Markus,,01/10/2013,anglais,A question of context: the influence of trust on leadership effectiveness during crisis,"This paper examines the mediating role of trust for leadership effectiveness in a crisis and a non-crisis context. Data from employees was collected before and after the collapse of Lehman Brothers leading to the most severe crisis since the Great Depression. The findings indicate significant differences in the role played by trust for the relationships between leadership and follower selfefficacy and work effort. Trust was found to play a greater role during times of stability than during times of high uncertainty, providing a great number of questions for future research."
Leroy Julie,Cova Salle,01/10/2013,anglais,Zooming in VS zooming out on value co-creation,"The concept of value co-creation is now taken for granted in the marketing community. It is the result of what we consider as a premature closure of this concept. The aim of this article is to prevent this premature closure by confronting what this discipline has produced thus far in order to highlight the breadth of situations that this concept presumes to encompass. To achieve this, we analyze a selection of articles published in special issues of marketing journals that were dedicated to value co-creation and/or service dominant logic. This sample enables us to point to the risks of being locked into a zoom-out approach to economic exchange: an arbitrary reduction of the vast heterogeneity of exchange phenomena and an inability to account for the complexity of these phenomena. Because value co-creation is a conception that is in conflict with the zoom-in approach to exchange phenomena, our intent is to conduct a healthy rebalancing of perspectives on economic exchange and thereby keep the controversy alive."
Mirzapour Al-E-Hashem Seyed Mohammad Javad,Baboli SAZVAR,01/10/2013,anglais,A stochastic aggregate production planning model in a green supply chain,"In this paper we develop a stochastic programming approach to solve a multi-period multi-product multi-site aggregate production planning problem in a green supply chain for a medium-term planning horizon under the assumption of demand uncertainty. The proposed model has the following features: (i) the majority of supply chain cost parameters are considered; (ii) quantity discounts to encourage the producer to order more from the suppliers in one period, instead of splitting the order into periodical small quantities, are considered; (iii) the interrelationship between lead time and transportation cost is considered, as well as that between lead time and greenhouse gas emission level; (iv) demand uncertainty is assumed to follow a pre-specified distribution function; (v) shortages are penalized by a general multiple breakpoint function, to persuade producers to reduce backorders as much as possible; (vi) some indicators of a green supply chain, such as greenhouse gas emissions and waste management are also incorporated into the model. The proposed model is first a nonlinear mixed integer programming which is converted into a linear one by applying some theoretical and numerical techniques. Due to the convexity of the model, the local solution obtained from linear programming solvers is also the global solution. Finally, a numerical example is presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed model."
Pardo Catherine,Ivens Wilson,01/10/2013,anglais,Assessing and strengthening internal alignment of new marketing units,"Business-to-business (B2B) marketing is a complexﬁeld requiring companies to put in place organizational units that are able to handle multifaceted interaction processes at the customer interface. Moreover, B2B marketing is characterized by high levels of technological, institutional etc. change. As a consequence, and in order to adapt to new market conditions, companies create new organizational units to take over tasks such as key account management, category management or social media management. These new units are developed within the pre-existing organization. Typically, these new units also display a high degree of cross-functionality since their activities are interdependent with the activities of other units. Hence, the question of alignment is of major importance. In this conceptual paper, we provide a framework for both scholarly research and managerial application. It is based on the concept of frame alignment and offers a lens allowing analyzing internal aligning processes for new B2B marketing units."
Schneider Lorenz,,01/10/2013,anglais,"Entropy, Relative Entropy and Variance Swaps","We study the problem of finding probability densities that match given European call option prices. To allow prior information about such a density to be taken into account, we generalize a previously presented algorithm to find the maximum entropy density of an asset price to the relative entropy case. This is applied to study the impact the choice of prior density has in two market scenarios. In the first scenario, call option prices are prescribed at only a small number of strikes, and we see that the choice of prior, or indeed its omission, yields notably different densities. The second scenario is given by CBOE option price data for S&P 500 index options at a large number of strikes. Prior information is now considered to be given by calibrated Heston, Schöbel-Zhu or Variance Gamma models. We find that the resulting digital option prices are essentially the same as those given by the (non-relative) Buchen-Kelly density itself. In other words, in a sufficiently liquid market the influence of the prior density seems to vanish almost completely. Finally, we study variance swaps and derive a simple formula relating the fair variance swap rate ( entropy. Then we show, again, that the prior loses its influence on the fair variance swap rate as the number of strikes increases."
Smith Celina,,01/10/2013,anglais,How family businesses respond to environmental jolts,"An inductive case study of four firms that varied in their response to the same environmental jolt is used to explore the processes by which entrepreneurs engage in behaviours that risk negative impacts on their businesses. The study finds that notions of brinkmanship found in game theory and international negotiations research can explain behaviours in which family firms deliberately risk negative firm outcomes. Further, family firms engage in brinkmanship behavior with increasing levels of intensity: tentative, assertive, and pre-emptive. Three factors were identified that influenced the levels of intensity they adopt: place attachment, ownership structure, and management style. The contribution of this study is to introduce the notion of organizational brinkmanship into family business and management research."

Alperovych Yan,Hubner Lobet,19/09/2013,anglais,Venture capital-backing and public investor,"Using the dataset of 315 SMEs, which received venture capital financing during the period 1998-2007, and several carefully constructed control samples this study sheds new light on the implications of investor type on efficiency patterns of Belgian entrepreneurial SMEs during first 3 years after the initial capital injection. There are three main findings. First, we observe increases in efficiency of venture capital-backed firms. Firms financed by private funds show higher efficiency levels and changes relative to their publicly-backed peers. Second, regression analyses indicate that for venture capital-backed firms public backing translates into statistically and economically significant reductions of efficiency. Finally, venture capital in general does not imply better efficiency patterns of the portfolio firms in comparison to their non-venture-backed peers. At the very least, better efficiency with respect to the control group might be observed for the privately-backed SMEs but this result is not stable."
Billette de Villemeur Etienne,Flochel Versaevel,01/09/2013,anglais,Optimal Collusion with Limited Liability,"Collusion sustainability depends on firms’ aptitude to impose sufficiently severe punishments in case of deviation from the collusive rule. We extend results from the literature on optimal collusion by investigating the role of limited liability. We examine all situations in which either structural conditions (demand and technology), financial considerations (a profitability target), or institutional circumstances (a regulation) set a lower bound, possibly negative, to firms’ profits. For a large class of repeated games with discounting, we show that, absent participation and limited liability constraints, there exists a unique optimal penal code. It commands a severe single-period punishment immediately after a firm deviates from the collusive stage-game strategy. When either the participation constraint or the limited liability constraint bind, there exists an infinity of multi-period punishment paths that permit firms to implement the optimal collusive strategy. The usual front-loading scheme is only a specific case and an optimal punishment profile can take the form of a price asymmetric cycle. We characterize the situations in which a longer punishment does not perform as a perfect substitute for more immediate severity. In this case the lowest discount factor that permits collusion is strictly higher than without the limited liability constraint, which hinders collusion."
Fayolle Alain,,01/09/2013,anglais,Personal views on the future of entrepreneurship education,"Entrepreneurship education is growing worldwide, but key educational and didactical issues remain. What are we talking about when we talk about entrepreneurship education? What are we really doing when we teach or educate people in entrepreneurship, in terms of the nature and the impact of our interventions? What do we know about the appropriateness, the relevancy, the coherency, the social usefulness and the efficiency of our initiatives and practices in entrepreneurship education? Addressing these issues and challenges, this article suggests that at least two major evolutions might reinforce the future of entrepreneurship education. First, we need strong intellectual and conceptual foundations, drawing from the fields of entrepreneurship and education, to strengthen our entrepreneurship courses. And finally, we also need to deeply reflect on our practices, as researchers and educators, taking a more critical stance toward a too often adopted “taken for granted” position."
JEMAI Zied,Rekik KALAI,01/09/2013,anglais,Inventory routing problems in a context of vendor-managed inventory system with consignment stock and transshipment,"The inventory routing problem involves the integration and the coordination of two components of the logistics value chain: the inventory management and the vehicle routing decisions. In fact, the aim is to jointly decide on the distribution tour, from a distribution centre to a set of locations, and on the inventory policy for each location. Although many research investigations show great interest in policies such as transshipment or dynamic routings on the distribution system performances, these approaches are often criticised in practice as being too restrictive. In this article, we consider the inventory routing framework in a supplier integration context, i.e. a vendor-managed inventory with a consignment stock policy. Under such framework, we show that the transshipment brings more benefits than the classical context. In particular, we consider the case of static routings and we numerically show that transshipment permits to better optimise the distribution tours and to improve the global performance of the supply network."
Prange Christiane,,01/09/2013,anglais,Better at Home or Abroad?,"The literature on Chinese firms suggests that a major objective of internationalization is to compensate for latecomer disadvantages. Thus, asset exploration rather than asset exploitation is the dominant motive for moving abroad. In doing so, companies need to engage constantly in innovation, or, more generally, value-creation trajectories to develop cutting-edge technology and enhance their product portfolio. In this article, I introduce a model with research propositions on how firms engage in internationalization-innovation trajectories. An ambidexterity perspective is suggested to balance these strategies. Insights from 30 companies’ annual reports over five years are presented. Results confirm that Chinese firms follow ambidextrous strategies and complement internal process-oriented with external product-focused innovation."
Skarlicki Daniel P.,HOEGG AQUINO Nadisic,01/09/2013,anglais,Does injustice affect your sense of taste and smell?,"Unfair treatment can activate strong negative emotions among victims and third parties. Less is known about other innate and evolutionary-based reactions to unfairness, such as those that manifest themselves through our senses. In three experiments, we found that interpersonally unfair treatment at work, defined as treatment that violates an individual's sense of dignity and respect, triggered disgust emotions over and above anger which subsequently related to stronger taste and smell reactions to gustatory and olfactory stimuli. This effect was observed for pleasant and unpleasant tasting products, for agreeable and malodorous scents, and among both mistreatment victims and third parties. Our findings suggest that violations of dignity and respect can trigger an evolutionary based reaction that activates a human alarm system, warning individuals of impending threats even when no oral threat is imminent."
Alperovych Yan,Amess Wright,01/08/2013,anglais,Private equity firm experience and buyout vendor source,"Using a dataset comprising 88 Private Equity (PE) backed Leveraged Buyouts (LBOs) completed and exited during the period 1999–2008, this study sheds new light on the impact of buyout vendor source and PE investor experience on post-buyout efficiency during the first 3 years after the transaction. There are three main findings. First, we observe increases in post-buyout efficiency over time, although LBOs from different vendor source differ in terms of post-transaction efficiency levels and improvement trajectories. Private and divisional buyouts are more efficient than the average. Divisional buyouts show higher efficiency improvements than private and secondary buyouts. Secondary buyouts remain below the average. Second, multivariate analyses suggest a positive and significant effect of PE firm experience on post-buyout efficiency. Finally, the observed efficiency patterns seem to be convex, suggesting the major improvements happen in the first 2 years after the transaction."
Arregle Jean-Luc,MILLER Hitt Beamish,01/08/2013,anglais,Do regions matter?,"Traditional research suggests a relationship between country-level institutions and the location choices of MNEs. However, more recent theory suggests MNEs also focus on regions (semiglobalization). Therefore, this study examines institutional effects in the context of semiglobalization by considering the influences of three formal institutions (i.e., regulatory control, political democracy, capital investments) of countries and geographic regions on MNEs’ location choices of internationalization. We use a sample of Japanese MNEs operating in 45 countries within eight regions. The results show that their degree of internationalization into a country is influenced by both country and regional institutional environments. Additionally, a semiglobalization perspective provides better explanatory power than does the countrylevel perspective. These results present a new perspective on how MNEs consider institutional environments in their international strategy."
Batjargal Bat,Hitt Tsui Arregle Webb Miller,01/08/2013,anglais,"Institutional Polycentrism, Entrepreneurs' Social Networks, and New Venture Growth","What is the interrelationship among formal institutions, social networks, and new venture growth? Drawing on the theory of institutional polycentrism and social network theory, we examine this question using data on 637 entrepreneurs from four different countries. We find the confluence of weak and inefficient formal institutions to be associated with a larger number of structural holes in entrepreneurial social networks. While the effect of this institutional order on the revenue growth of new ventures is negative, a network's structural holes have a positive effect on revenue growth. Furthermore, the positive effect of structural holes on revenue growth is stronger in an environment with a more adverse institutional order (i.e., weaker and more inefficient institutions). The contributions and implications of these findings are discussed."

Crespin-Mazet Florence,Goglio-primard Scheid,01/08/2013,anglais,Open innovation processes within clusters,"Purpose – Little research focuses on the conditions under which companies open up to co-develop knowledge with external actors. Spatial proximity has been proved insufficient to generate successful open innovation processes: socio-economic proximity also seems required. This paper aims at better understanding how this new form of proximity can be organized and investigates the role of third parties or tertius iungens in this process. Design/methodology/approach – This paper is based on an exploratory case of successful open innovation between a software editor and a systems integrator located in the same cluster, relying on 50 face-to-face in-depth interviews, documentation and analysis of physical artifacts. Findings – It confirms that socio-economic and in particular coordination proximity favors open innovation processes. This proximity is facilitated by a third party acting as a sustained iungens to initiate contact between development partners and key customers, and to practically organize knowledge transfer. The paper suggests that to be effective this tertius iungens needs to occupy a central position in the local network and to exhibit the characteristics of an epistemic community. Research limitations/implications – Due to its exploratory design, the authors’ research exhibits several limitations in terms of generalization. It does not fully appreciate the specific interaction between the various dimensions of proximity and in what respect spatial proximity positively influences or reinforces the development of socioeconomic proximity. Further research is needed to analyze the relationships between these various forms of proximity and understand whether spatial proximity is required in a context where new information technologies ease up relationship and coordination mechanisms. Another limitation is linked to the character of the open innovation project analyzed which focused on an innovation of exploitation. Practical implications – This paper suggests that territorial engineering should favor the emergence of organizations playing the role of tertius iungens in the local network. Such organizations need to have the technical expertise and image of benevolence and integrity to manage knowledge transfer. Originality/value – Little research analyzes the role of third parties or tertius iungens in the emergence and management of open innovation processes. The literature on clusters has mostly highlighted that inter-organizational cooperation emerges from spatial proximity and can be organized by public authorities whereas most of the open innovation literature on software describes cooperation patterns that do not require any third party.

Fayolle Alain,Lamine,01/08/2013,anglais,A social network approach to a better understanding of the survival – growth phase of innovative new ventures,"In view of its perceived social and economic benefits, the creation of innovative new ventures is a priority of national public policies. It also constitutes a source of considerable interest within the broader frame work of European policies which aim to position EC economies among the most competitive in the world (European Council, 2000). However, in France, according to the National Institute for Economic Statistics, the failure rate of start-ups remains very high. Indeed, half the firms do not survive beyond the first five years. The current economic and financial context considerably reduces the appeal of start-ups and negatively affects the recognition of their legitimacy. This is all the more significant in the case of high-risk innovative firms since they emerge and develop within a context of uncertainty and information asymmetry (Fayolle, 2005) that makes potential investors more hesitant and less inclined to get involved (Sauner-Leroy, 2004). The high failure rate of young firms calls for further examination of their dynamics of failure or success with a view to better comprehending the phenomenon and thus increasing their chances of survival and growth. The issue of entrepreneurial success has received a lot of attention from scholars."

Fayolle Alain,Kyro METS Venesaar,01/08/2013,anglais,Introduction: entrepreneurial research - towards conceptual richness and methodological diversity,"The current volume continues the collaboration tradition of university researchers in the European University Network on Entrepreneurship – ESU. This fifth book in the series “European Research in Entrepreneurship” demonstrates the endeavours of the editorial leaders, the authors’ team and the ESU network to improve and widen the conceptual and methodological coverage of entrepreneurship research in Europe. The ESU network grew from the idea to gather together professors and doctoral students in entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship education around the Entrepreneurship Summer University concept initiated by the French Government in 2002. It is from that initiative that the idea originated to develop and collect together all the outcomes of entrepreneurship research into this book series. ESU was previously defined by Professor Kyrö (2010), as “fed by European culture and roots in their diversity and their specificities”, an accolade which equally characterizes this book series."
JONES Milo,Silberzahn,01/08/2013,anglais,Constructing Cassandra,"Constructing Cassandra conducts an inquiry into the intelligence failures at the CIA that resulted in four key strategic surprises experienced by the US: the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, the Iranian revolution of 1978, the collapse of the USSR in 1991, and the 9/11 terrorist attacks. While some of these events may seem distant, these surprises still play out today in US policy. Although there has been no shortage of studies exploring how intelligence failures can happen, none of the prevailing explanations has been able to provide a unified understanding of the phenomenon. Without that understanding, failures will happen again—with dramatic consequences. The book brings culture and identity to the foreground to present a model of strategic surprise that focuses on the internal make-up the CIA. It also takes seriously those Cassandras who offered warnings, but were ignored. By providing this novel, unified model of strategic surprise—that links terrorist attacks to more conventional failures—this book offers the first deep and systematic exploration of the ultimate sources of the CIA's intelligence failures, and points to ways to prevent future strategic surprises."
Marti Ignasi,Fernandez,01/08/2013,anglais,The Institutional Work of Oppression and Resistance,"In recent years there has been an outburst of studies aiming to advance our understanding of how actors do work to create, maintain and disrupt institutions. Drawing on work on the Holocaust, a largely neglected event in organization theory, we explore types of institutional work through which actors first maintain domination and grant acquiescence to oppression and, second, target oppressive systems through acts of resistance. This approach offers an opportunity to study a familiar set of processes and phenomena on fresh terms and to focus on key elements that existing studies on institutional work have neglected."

The article stresses the functions of materialistic goal pursuit, the processes by which these functions are developed and implemented, and their potential consequences.

The article discusses the utility of this conceptualization of materialism in relation to other conceptualizations and suggests avenues for future research."
Arregle Jean-Luc,Miller Hitt Beamish,01/07/2013,anglais,The Institutional Diversity of Regions and MNEs' Internationalization,"Semi-globalization emphasizes the role of geographic regions in MNEs’ internationalization due to the possibility of developing region-bound firm specific advantages and arbitrage. In this paper, we develop and test hypotheses about the effects of a region’s institutional diversity on MNEs’ propensity to internationalize in a country, as it influences the possibility and cost of RFSAs and arbitrage. We develop hypotheses about a Ushaped relationship between a region’s institutional diversity, differentiating formal and informal institutions, and the propensity of a MNE to internationalize in a country in this region. We test these hypotheses on a sample of Japanese MNEs operating in 45 countries within eight regions. The results validate these U-shaped relationships showing that a region’s diversity plays an important and complex role in semi-globalization. These results present a new perspective to understand how regions’ characteristics explain semi-globalization and MNEs’ internationalization."
Bertoni Fabio,Lugo,01/07/2013,anglais,Testing the Strategic Asset Allocation of Stabilization Sovereign Wealth Funds,"None of the models that have been developed to determine the optimal strategic asset allocation (SAA) of stabilization sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) has received direct empirical validation, primarily because there is a lack of transparency regarding some of the key parameters that characterize the problem. In this paper, building on a mean-variance framework, we derive three sets of parsimonious statistical tests to compare the actual SAA of SWFs to a theoretical optimum. We apply these tests to the portfolio of the world's largest stabilization SWF (the Norwegian Government Pension Fund—Global or GPF) for the period between 2002 and 2005. The empirical analysis confirms that the static and dynamic deviations of the GPF's SAA from the market equity portfolio are consistent with the theoretical predictions."
Crawshaw Jonathan R.,Cropanzano Bell Nadisic,01/07/2013,anglais,Organizational justice,"Both organizational justice and behavioural ethics are concerned with questions of ‘right and wrong’ in the context of work organizations. Until recently they have developed largely independently of each other, choosing to focus on subtly different concerns, constructs and research questions. The last few years have, however, witnessed a significant growth in theoretical and empirical research integrating these closely related academic specialities. We review the organizational justice literature, illustrating the impact of behavioural ethics research on important fairness questions. We argue that organizational justice research is focused on four reoccurring issues: (i) why justice at work matters to individuals; (ii) how justice judgements are formed; (iii) the consequences of injustice; and (iv) the factors antecedent to justice perceptions. Current and future justice research has begun and will continue borrowing from the behavioural ethics literature in answering these questions."

Kokash Rasmi,,01/07/2013,anglais,The Effect of Corporate Entrepreneurship and Organizational Knowledge Creation on Firm Second-order Competences: Evidence from Knowledge-Intensive Sectors,"Whereas corporate entrepreneurship (CE) is viewed to influence firm competences, their relationship, along with organizational knowledge creation, remains largely unexplored. Towards that end, this research examines what and how different forms of CE actions (e.g. innovation, strategic renewal and corporate venturing), influence various firm second-order competences such as second- order marketing and R&D competences. It is further argued that firm second-order competences are also influenced by firm knowledge creation modes. By proposing a linkage between CE and firm competences- herein referred to as second-order competences, along with organizational knowledge creation effects, this research develops, and then, tests a model of firmlevel entrepreneurship in context of competence development. Informed by literatures of Austrian school of economics, entrepreneurship, resource based view of the firm and organization knowledge creation perspective, it is proposed that firm second-order competences are variously influenced, in part, by different firm-level entrepreneurship activities, and, in part, by different organizational knowledge creation modes. Analysis of data collected from 37 firms, from various knowledgeintensive sectors, using regression modeling, confirms the proposed model."

We identify a range of “narrative attributions”, alternative accounts of failure that actors draw on to process the failure and their role in it. Our analysis provides a view of entrepreneurial failure as a complex social construction, as entrepreneurs, hired executives, employees and the media construct failure in distinctively different ways. Narratives provide means for both cognitive and emotional processing of failure through grief recovery and self-justification."
Quittard-Pinon François,Kelani,01/07/2013,anglais,Pricing Equity Index Annuities with Surrender Options in Four Models,"Equity-indexed annuities (EIAs) have generated a great deal of interest since Keyport Life first launched “Key Index” in February 1995. They are considered to be the most innovative products to appear on the market in years. EIAs are, essentially equity-linked deferred annuities which provide the policyholder with a guaranteed accumulation rate on their premium, and also at maturity, benefits from an additional return based on the performance of an equity mutual fund or a family of mutual funds or a stock index, typically of the Standard and Poor’s (S&P500) index, so the customer can profit from the growth of the stock market. Product designs of EIAs can vary, depending on the companies that sell them. In this article, we focus on the pricing of one of the product designs in the market which gives the possibility to surrender their policy before maturity. Such options can be valued using Monte Carlo simulation method proposed for pricing American options but, here, we use the least squares Monte Carlo suggested by Longstaff and Schwartz added to the control variate tool in order to construct efficient estimators. We analyze these equity-linked life insurance contracts under four different models. The frameworks differ from the way we model the price of the fund associated with the contract. The first setting is the usual Black and Scholes model, the second is the environment of jump diffusions, especially a Kou process, the third is the regime switching log normal model (RSLN) developed by Hamilton and the fourth is a mixed of a regime switching and a jump diffusion. The surrender option is priced using the Longstaff and Schwartz methodology."
Bian Dong,WU,01/06/2013,anglais,Brand management: How did Chinese fashion companies develop their brands?,"In March 2013, the Chinese first lady, Mrs Peng Liyuan accompanied the new president of China's central government for his first overseas visit in some countries. Her elegant dressing caught the attention of public media. Later on, a Chinese company officially announced that Peng's clothes wearing during the visit were designed by the teams of two Chinese designer brands, EXCEPTION and WUYONG. The news led people to ponder over the development situation of the fashion industry in China. China had been the biggest exporter of garments for many years, but the profit margin for this industry in China was quite low. With the influx of multinational companies and the growth of the OEM business, the fashion market in China was full of western labels. However, few Chinese brands can be called out by consumers. As the overseas demand declined, more and more Chinese OEM manufacturers are seeking to create their own brands to improve the profit margin. What is the current fashion market situation in China? Is it a good time to establish a local fashion brand, and how? Are there any successful Chinese fashion brands? Could their development path be followed? How to enhance the competitiveness of a start-up local brand? This case reviews one business platform and seven typical Chinese fashion brands, and leads to the analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of their business model and branding strategies."

Backed by governmental incentive policies, global PV markets, especially in Europe, it had been expanding rapidly. Manufacturers in the different parts of the industrial value chain around the world benefited from the explosive demand, and the leadership had shifted from the US to Japan, Europe and Asia. China took over the top position through ten-year endeavour in technological improvements. Chinese enterprises were dominating the global market with more than 60% of shares, especially in cell and module productions, as a result of an aggressive pricing strategy versus the branding strategy adopted by some other oversea PV giants, like SolarWorld. Some American and European PV enterprises led by SolarWorld filed antidumping (AD) and countervailing (CV) petitions with the US government against their Chinese counterparts. And the tariff duties came after the investigations had brought a huge amount of loss to Chinese companies and even put them on the edge of bankruptcy. What could Chinese PV firms do to prevent further deterioration? How could they keep sustainable in global markets? Is it necessary for them to change strategies in international competition to cope with upcoming shocks from the European government and competitors? The case reviews the development situation of the PV industry, especially that in China and Germany, and analyses the competitive strategies taken by two PV giants in the two countries in detail. The case is applicable for the course of international strategy with students in MBA or EMBA level."

Bian Dong,WU,01/06/2013,anglais,Nanrenwa: How to make it a successful business model?,"Online shopping had become quite popular during the last decade. It provided consumers a more convenient and cheaper way to buy goods. e-commerce also helped sellers to expand distribution channels and reach more consumers. Various innovative business models had been developed by e-commerce companies. NanRenWa was one of most typical examples. The company had an e-commerce website and simply sold man socks and underwear in China. In less than two years, the online store’s total number of customers increased to 45,000 plus. The estimated sales were more than 500,000 pairs of socks, worth of 650,000 US dollars. Why could a small enterprise with quite simple products be reported by different types of Chinese public media, like sina.com, ifeng.com and China National Radio? What kind of business model had they adopted? How could the company expand its business and maintain competitiveness in the future? This case reviews NanRenWa’s business model, organization structure and development situation in 2013, and leads to the analysis of advantages, disadvantages and development potential of this kind of business model."
JOHNSON Alan R.,,01/06/2013,anglais,A Minority influence Interpretation of Members' Interpersonal Processes and Team Level Outcomes using Bayesian Estimation and Bayes Factors,"The purpose of the study was to investigate how members’ interpersonal processes observed at the individual level determine team outcomes at the cluster level. I focus on two dimensions of interpersonal processes from previous research and theory, the extent to which members discuss and disagree about their work. I labeled the first construct dimension task debate, which is based on the information sharing literature (Stasser & Titus, 1985, 1987), and the second construct dimension task conflict, which is based on the intragroup conflict literature (Jehn & Mannix, 2001; Jehn, 1995). From minority influence theory (Moscovici, 1980, 1985a), I hypothesized that task conflict moderates (generally positive) relations between task debate and team outcomes. However, I extended De Drue and West’s (2001) contingent model by proposing that the moderated effects are (a) in alternate directions for early, middle, and late episodes and (b) generalize to several important outcome variables in the team effectiveness literature; performance, satisfaction, and creativity. Specifically, in early episodes, task conflict is a positive moderator; in middle episodes, it is negative; and in late episodes, it is positive again. I explore my thesis using a sample of 60 student teams (360 individuals) working together during 5 months (21 weeks) to write a first business plan for a new venture. I surveyed members on weeks 1, 9, and 17 about their interpersonal processes and collected data from archival, observer-rated, and self-reported sources on outcomes in week 21. I used Bayesian estimation for my latent variable modeling approach; (a) to indicator measurement error, (b) to individual selection error, and (c) to missing data on the predictor variables. Finally, a Bayes factor analysis of my informative hypothesis revealed moderately convincing support from the data for my model where no such support was forthcoming from traditional graphing and post hoc probing of the moderated relations."
Langevin Pascal,Mendoza,01/06/2013,anglais,How can management control system fairness reduce managers' unethical behaviours?,"Empirical research has shown that as management control systems (MCS) put heavy pressure on managers to achieve their objectives, they may induce two types of unethical behaviour: creation of budgetary slack and data manipulation. Recently, studies have introduced Organisational Justice theory into the area of management accounting research and shown the positive effects of organisational justice on managers’ attitudes and behaviours. However, few studies have systematically analysed how MCS fairness reduces unethical behaviours and which characteristics of MCS could increase managers’ perception that they are treated fairly. The purpose of the paper is to contribute to this research. It formulates testable hypotheses on how some specific dimensions of MCS can enhance perceived fairness, which in turn helps to reduce the creation of slack and data manipulation through increased Organisational Commitment and Trust in supervisor."
Le Courtois Olivier,Randrianarivony,01/06/2013,anglais,On the Bankruptcy Risk of Insurance Companies,"The fall of AIG proved that the insurance business is not immune to bankruptcy, contrary to the actuarial literature which postulates that insurance firms can survive forever. In this article we model the surplus process of an insurance firm firstly by a stable Lévy process, secondly by a double exponential compound Poisson process. We compute finite-time survival and bankruptcy probabilities under such hypotheses. To achieve this, we make use of the Wiener-Hopf factorization and compute bankruptcy formulas written in terms of inverse Laplace transforms. The Abate and Whitt, and Gaver-Stehfest algorithms are used to obtain numerical estimations. This article can be viewed as an illustration of a general approach to the bankruptcy of financial institutions."

Most explanations start with Gibrat's rule of proportional growth but require additional constraints. We show that Gibrat's rule, at all firm levels, yields Zipf's law under a balance condition between the effective growth rate of incumbent firms (which includes their possible demise) and the growth rate of investments in entrant firms. Under the additional assumption that firms do not consume more resources than available, we show that Zipf's law is the signature that firms grow at the maximum reachable long-term rate."

Through a netnographic analysis of a virtual health community organization, we explore how social media are used by consumers and organizations in order to design unconventional systems of interface that empower them to participate in production and distribution processes. Findings identify different levels of surveillance and the resulting emergence of a new agency distribution among marketing entities. We argue that surveillance, rather than privacy, becomes a determinant for organizing market relations, and sustains business systems that allow for such organization."

Bid Witkey was the most well-developed witkey business. From 2006 to 2012, both annual completed services and the RMB value were increased by over 87 and 45 times respectively. The total transaction value of the industry exceeded 2 billion RMB. There were hundreds of witkey websites competing for a slice of the pie. However, some new witkey websites came out after some were shut down. Zhubajie.com started to lead the witkey industry from 2008. The website achieved 80% of the market share in 2013. Why did some witkey platforms succeed but others failed? Is the success of zhubajie.com sustainable? How could the witkey websites adjust their business models and corporate strategies to dig out the potential of the business? This case gives a clear definition of the witkey and reviews its commercialization process. Particularly, the detailed information of zhubajie.com can help students have a deep insight from the perspective of an enterprise, so as to have a good understanding of the emerging platform economy, business model innovation and competitive strategy."
Gong Yeming,de Koster Frenk Gabor,01/05/2013,anglais,Increasing the Revenue of Self-Storage Warehouses by Facility Design,"Self-storage is a booming industry. Both private customers and companies can rent temporary space from such facilities. The design of self-storage warehouses differs from other facility designs in its focus on revenue maximization. A major question is how to design self-storage facilities to fit market segments and accommodate volatile demand to maximize revenue. Customers that cannot be accommodated with a space size of their choice can be either rejected or upscaled to a larger space. Based on data of 54 warehouses in America, Europe, and Asia, we propose a new facility design approach with models for three different cases: an overflow customer rejection model and two models with customer upscale possibilities, one with reservation and another without reservation. We solve the models for several real warehouse cases, and our results show that the existing self-storage warehouses can be redesigned to generate larger revenues for all cases. Finally, we show that the upscaling policy without reservation generally outperforms the upscaling policy with reservation."
Lipuma Joseph,NEWBERT Doh,01/05/2013,anglais,The effect of institutional quality on firm export performance in emerging economies,"It is widely accepted that countries with sound formal and informal institutions create more robust environments for firm performance. However, due to the liabilities faced by firms without available slack and/or market power, we contend that institutions are especially important for new and small firms. Unfortunately, there is little research examining the potential moderating effect of firm size or age on the relationship between institutional quality and export performance. In response, we hypothesize that institutional quality will be more important to increasing the export performance of new and small firms compared with their large, established counterparts. We test our hypotheses using data from the World Bank’s World Business Environment Survey. The results of our analyses offer support for our model, although some institutional variables appear to be more important to export performance than others. We conclude by discussing the implications of our results."
Espinoza Petersen Francine,Heine,01/04/2013,anglais,When Do Consumers Indulge in Luxury?,"To counter the growing competition in the luxury market, luxury brands may develop competitive advantages by better understanding the phenomenon of emotion regulation consumption, or consumers’ desire to indulge in luxury products to regulate their emotional state. While some people may engage in “retail therapy” when they feel bad, others embark on a shopping spree the minute they feel good. Thus, the positive or negative valence of the emotional state alone cannot fully explain emotion regulation consumption. Based on literature in emotions and indulgent behaviour, we propose that the effect of the valence of an emotional experience on preferences for luxury products is contingent on the certainty appraisal associated with the emotion, which will signal consumers whether their emotional state can change or not. Thus, the paper concentrates on the certainty-uncertainty component of emotions and investigates in two complementary studies how this component influences emotion regulation by luxury consumption. The results of this research demonstrate that the certainty appraisal associated with an emotion influences people’s willingness to engage in luxury consumption as a way to regulate their emotions. First, we demonstrate that people in a negative emotional state associated with uncertainty (e. g., fear) are more willing to indulge in luxury products than those in a negative emotional state associated with certainty (e. g., anger) because luxury consumption would help them repair their emotional state. People in a certain negative emotional state are less willing to indulge because in this case luxury consumption would not help them repair their emotional state. Second, results show that participants in a positive emotional state associated with uncertainty (e. g., hope) are less likely to consume luxury products than those in a positive state associated with certainty (e. g., happiness) because luxury consumption could hurt their pleasant emotions, which they wish to maintain. The main theoretical contribution of this research is to show that the certainty appraisal moderates the effect of the valence of emotions on emotion regulation by signalling to consumers whether their emotional state can change or not. Theoretically, this helps to understand why different emotions of the same valence make consumers more or less willing to engage in emotion regulation. In addition, the key behaviour examined in this research is luxury consumption. Thus, besides showing the certainty appraisal signals when to regulate emotion, we apply these findings to a context relevant to marketing. By doing this, we integrate and contribute to research in emotions, emotion regulation, and indulgent behaviour, in particular luxury consumption. This research helps luxury brand managers to improve their understanding of when people in a positive or negative emotional state will engage in luxury consumption. Results demonstrate that it does not make much sense to invest in marketing activities to encourage emotional luxury consumption on the basis of people’s good or bad emotional state alone. Any emotional state may mean to marketers both a chance and an obstacle to sell consumers a luxury product. The results provide marketers some guidelines on how to encourage emotional luxury consumption by fine-tuning their emotional marketing techniques. For example, they explain why a luxury brand may prefer a happy"" advertisement to a ""hopeful"" one, though both are positive emotions."""
Heine Klaus,Phan,01/04/2013,anglais,A Case Study of Shanghai Tang,"This case focuses on Shanghai Tang, the first truly Chinese luxury brand that appeals to both Westerners and, more recently, to Chinese consumers worldwide. A visionary and wealthy businessman Sir David Tang created this company from scratch in 1994 in Hong Kong. Its story, spanned over almost two decades, has been fascinating. It went from what best a Chinese brand could be in the eyes of Westerners who love the Chinese culture, to a nearly-bankrupted company in 1998, before being acquired by Richemont, the second largest luxury group in the world. Since then, its turnaround has been spectacular with a growing appeal among Chinese luxury consumers who represent the core segment of the luxury industry today. The main objective of this case study is to formally examine how Shanghai Tang overcame its downfall and re-emerged as one the very few wellknown Chinese luxury brands. More specifically, this case highlights the ways with which Shanghai Tang made a transitional change from a brand for Westerners who love the Chinese culture, to a brand for both, Westerners who love the Chinese culture and Chinese who love luxury. A close examination reveals that Shanghai Tang has followed the brand identity concept that consists of two major components: functional and emotional. The functional component for developing a luxury brand concerns all product characteristics that will make a product ‘luxurious’ in the eyes of the consumer, such as premium quality of cachemire from Mongolia, Chinese silk, lacquer, finest leather, porcelain, and jade in the case of Shanghai Tang. The emotional component consists of non-functional symbolic meanings of a brand. The symbolic meaning marks the major difference between a premium and a luxury brand. In the case of Shanghai Tang, its symbolic meaning refers to the Chinese culture and the brand aims to represent the best of Chinese traditions and establish itself as “the ambassador of modern Chinese style”. It touches the Chinese heritage and emotions. Shanghai Tang has reinvented the modern Chinese chic by drawing back to the stylish decadence of Shanghai in the 1930s, which was then called the “Paris of the East”, and this is where the brand finds inspiration to create its own myth. Once the functional and emotional components assured, Shanghai Tang has gone through a four-stage development to become the first global Chinese luxury brand: introduction, deepening, expansion, and revitalization. Introduction: David Tang discovered a market gap and had a vision to launch the first Chinese luxury brand to the world. The key success drivers for the introduction and management of a Chinese luxury brand are a solid brand identity and, above all, a creative mind, an inspired person. This was David Tang then, and this is now Raphael Le Masne de Chermont, the current Executive Chairman. Shanghai Tang combines Chinese and Western elements, which it finds to be the most sustainable platform for drawing consumers. Deepening: A major objective of the next phase is to become recognized as a luxury brand and a fashion or design authority. For this purpose, Shanghai Tang has cooperated with other well-regarded luxury and lifestyle brands such as Puma and Swarovski. It also expanded its product lines from high-end custom- made garments to music CDs and restaurant. Expansion: After the opening of his first store in Hong Kong in 1994, David Tang went on to open his second store in New York City three years later. However this New York retail operation was a financial disaster. Barely nineteen months after the opening, the store was shut down and quietly relocated to a cheaper location of Madison Avenue. Despite this failure, Shanghai Tang products found numerous followers especially among Western tourists and became “souvenir-like” must-haves. However, despite its strong brand DNA, the brand did not generate enough repeated sales and over the years the company cumulated heavy debts and became unprofitable. Revitalizing: After its purchase by Richemont in 1998, Le Masne de Chermont was appointed to lead the company, reposition the brand and undertake some major strategic changes such as revising the “Shanghai Tang” designs to appeal not only to Westerners but also to Chinese consumers, and to open new stores around the world. Since then, Shanghai Tang has become synonymous to a modern Chinese luxury lifestyle brand."
Calcagno Riccardo,FALCONIERI,01/03/2013,anglais,Competition and dynamics of takeover contests,"This paper investigates the effect of potential competition on takeovers which we model as a bargaining game with alternating offers where calling an auction represents an outside option for each bidder at each stage of the game. The model aims to answer three main questions: who wins the takeover? when? and how? Our results are able to explain why the takeover premium resulting from a negotiated deal is not significantly different from that resulting from an auction, and why tender offers are rarely observed in reality. Furthermore, the model allows us to draw conclusions on how other dimensions of the takeover process, such as termination fees, target resistance and tender offer costs, affect its dynamics and outcome."

We find that households with higher levels of financial literacy hold a relatively lower share of illiquid wealth, and the results are more pronounced at older ages, when according to the lifecycle hypothesis they are meant to decumulate their assets. Results appear robust to different specifications of the dependent variable and potential endogeneity of financial literacy."
HARGREAVES Dougal S.,MCVEY Nairn VINER,01/03/2013,anglais,Relative importance of individual and social factors in improving adolescent health,"Aims: In 2010, the English Department of Health launched a radical new public health strategy, which sees individual factors, such as self-esteem, as the key to improving all aspects of young people’s health. This article compares the strength of association between key adolescent health outcomes and a range of individual and social factors Methods: All participants aged 12–15 in the nationally representative 2008 Healthy Foundations survey were included. Six individual factors related to self-esteem, confidence and personal responsibility, and seven social factors related to family, peers, school and local area were investigated. Single-factor and multivariable logistic regression models were used to calculate the association between these factors and seven health outcomes (self-reported general health, physical activity, healthy eating, weight, smoking, alcohol intake, illicit drug use). Odds ratios were adjusted for gender, age and deprivation. Results: Individual factors such as self-esteem were associated with general health, physical activity and healthy eating. However, the influence of family, peers, school and local community appear to be equally important for these outcomes and more important for smoking, drug use and healthy weight. Conclusion: Self-esteem interventions alone are unlikely to be successful in improving adolescent health, particularly in tackling obesity and reducing substance misuse."

In this paper, we use the generalized Fourier analysis for pricing and hedging that proves to be fast and accurate. For hedging we use a local risk minimization and pseudo differential operators to give a concise formula for the hedging ratio. An important problem we address is that hedging has to be solved in the historical world while pricing is done in the risk-neutral world. We apply this procedure to the Guarantees for Maturity Benefit, Minimum Death Benefit, and the Minimum Accumulated Benefit."

The basis for the condition is the comparison of the likelihood ratio distributions. I show, first, that Kim’s criterion is not necessary when the limited liability of the agent binds. I derive, in the binomial model, a less restrictive necessary and sufficient condition. This new criterion compares the likelihood ratios, but only for the high outcome. It also compares the marginal productivities of effort. In contrast, when the limited liability does not bind, I find that Kim’s criterion is necessary and sufficient in the binomial model. Second, when the first-order approach is not valid, I show that Kim’s criterion is no longer sufficient: the principal might be better off with a less informative (in Kim’s sense) monitoring technology."
Lawton Thomas,Rajwani Doh,01/02/2013,anglais,The antecedents of political capabilities,"Governments and ownership structures can both facilitate and constrain organizational value creation. Firm-level political strategy is a frequent response to protect or promote organizational interests. When effectively configured and implemented, these political strategies can become capabilities. This inductive study examines the antecedents of political capabilities in European airlines within the context of cross-border market deregulation. Our central contribution is an understanding of how management teams from non-state and state airlines organize and develop divergent corporate political capabilities in this context. While managers’ actions in response to specific public policy processes can create political capabilities, the outcome is moderated by the nature of corporate ownership and the relative influence of public and private stakeholders on capability formation. Our theoretical contribution is to extend the study of organizational capabilities into the non-market context through analyzing how European flag carrier airlines organized their political capabilities in anticipation of a changing transnational policy context."
Monin Philippe,NOORDERHAVEN Vaara Kroon,01/02/2013,anglais,Giving Sense to and Making Sense of Justice in Postmerger Integration,"The objective of this paper is to elucidate how justice in general and distributive justice in particular is given sense to and made sense of in post-merger integration. Drawing on a longitudinal real time analysis of a recent merger, we identify a pattern where the focus moved from equality to equity to less emphasis on distributive justice. To understand the dynamics involved, we develop a process model that explains how actors reconcile pressures of value creation and socio-political concerns in dialogical sensegiving and sensemaking processes that lead to the enactment of specific norms of justice. This analysis adds to research on M&As by facilitating our understanding of the crucial role that norms of justice play in post-merger integration, of the way in which they change over time as integration processes unfold, and of the inter-group dynamics through which these norms of justice are enacted. By uncovering the micro-dynamics of dialogical sensegiving and sensemaking processes, we also contribute to research on organizational justice, sensemaking, and process studies."
Gong Yeming,,01/01/2013,anglais,Fundamental Algorithms for Public Storage,"Physical Internet is a new fundamental paradigm to change global logistics and public storage is among the most critical operations in PI. We consider a public storage warehouse, facing a set of reservations for homogeneous or heterogeneous storage units over a certain time horizon with revenue rewards. The warehouse operation manager has to decide which storage requests to accept and schedule them in different storage units to maximize the revenue. We model warehouse operations as scheduling n independent multiprocessor tasks with given start and end times, with an objective to maximize total revenue. We identify 5 cases for basic operations and show that two polynomial algorithms can solve the basic problem optimally for all cases. If homogeneous storage units are considered, our algorithm has a time complexity of O((nlog n)²). For heterogeneous storage units, the time complexity of our algorithm is bounded by O(nm+1). We further consider more complex problems with upgrading operations, and employ column generation algorithm to solve the problem. Finally, we consider the application to self-storage warehouses in different countries, and show our algorithm can improve the revenue by 8.05% on average and at least 5.8% for warehouses with basic operations, and by 12.63% on average and at least 7.5% for warehouses with upgrading operations."
Gong Yeming,,01/01/2013,anglais,Using storage profiles and truncated bucket brigades to improve order picking productivity,"A traditional bucket brigade picking protocol is limited in how much advantage it can take of intelligent item storage assignments since the team must walk from the start of the pick line to the end for each order. We explore how, in contrast, a truncated bucket brigade protocol can naturally exploit a storage assignment strategy by allowing the team to truncate the pick line, by use of some technology, to where the actual picks for each order are required. We derive expressions for the expected production rate for both a traditional and truncated bucket brigade for three different classes of storage profiles: a uniform (random) profile, a class of volume-based storage (VBS) profiles (using Pareto curves), and a class of class-based storage (CBS) profiles. We find that a truncated bucket brigade protocol can achieve substantial gains in productivity by reducing the amount of walking necessary by the team."
Lawton Thomas,Mcguire Rajwani,01/01/2013,anglais,Corporate Political Activity,"This paper reviews the diverse literature on corporate political activity (CPA) and develops a framework that details and integrates existing research in this field. A systematic analysis of extant CPA literatures is conducted to order them into domains that have implications for organizational performance. The paper is structured into three such domain emphases, which require further research investigation: resources and capabilities focus; institutional focus; and political environment focus. The contribution of each to an understanding of CPA in pursuit or defence of corporate competitive advantage is discussed.The authors also suggest that the internationalization of business, including the more recent emergence of developing country economies and companies, presents scholars with the challenge of understanding CPA in more varied institutional settings. CPA practices continue to expand as commerce goes increasingly global and, consequently, involves a wider array of political actors and institutions. The paper contributes by increasing the clarity of CPA classification, reflecting on the implications of a multi-polar world for CPA research and advancing future agendas for scholars in this research community."
Le Courtois Olivier,NAKAGAWA,01/01/2013,anglais,On Surrender and Default Risks,"This article examines certain types of saving institutions or insurance companies that are subject to surrender and default risks, in a stochastic interest rate context. In the setting under study, investors are endowed with an option to surrender. The goal of the article is to study how this option impacts the default risk of the issuing company and the value of the contracts it issues. Surrender risk has been extensively studied in arbitrated markets, using trees or least-squares Monte-Carlo methods for valuations, although practitioners often rely on econometric methods. We deal with surrender risk in a third way, assuming policyholders have sets of information and preferences that differ from those of financial market agents, but without relying on econometric methods. In particular, policyholders are supposed to be only partially rational (at least in the financial sense). This is done by modeling surrender risk through a Cox process correlated to the assets and interest rate dynamics. The article provides formulas for the dynamics of the assets of the issuing firm (these dynamics drive the default time of the company), and for the valuation of liabilities and equity. A numerical illustration is provided"

With respect to the interests of the civil parties, the French Supreme Court applied the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage'' (CLC) of November 27, 1992. However, the solutions adopted by the Court of Cassation based on this Convention, more specifically the decision to hold the Total oil company liable and the manner in which environmental harm was recognized and remedied, are surprising from a strictly legal point of view.

Customer choice behavior, such as buy-up and buy-down, is an important element in revenue management of public storage warehouses. To consider this behavior, the customer choice model is used to specify the probability of purchase for each fare product as a function of the set of fare products offered. This paper proposes models and solving algorithms to design public storage warehouses with considering the choice behavior of customers. We consider two application settings: (1) For the problems without the re-layout within examining horizon, we solve it by mixed integer programming. (2)For the problems with re-layout, we solve it mainly by column generation algorithms."
ANTIOCO Michael,VANHAMME HARDY BERNARDIN,01/12/2012,anglais,On the importance of social integration for minority targeting effectiveness,"Research into the influence of model ethnicity on advertising effectiveness usually compares a dominant or mainstream group with a single, ethnically distinctive minority group. Such two-group studies implicitly assume that all minorities react similarly to distinctive and non-distinctive models portrayed in ads. However, minorities differ in their level of integration into the dominant societal group, which likely influences their responses. This research studies target/non-target market effects for minorities whose levels of integration into the host society vary. In contrast with relatively less integrated minorities, minority groups better integrated into the dominant society exhibit target/non-target market effects unlike those previously reported. This study also contrasts two mediation routes for the observed effects of ethnic models: ad model–self-perceived similarity and perceived ad model credibility. The results show that the two routes are confounded for less integrated minorities but dissociated for better integrated minorities. The findings offer clear applications for the advertising industry."

We assume that independent venture capital firms provide better support quality while bank-affiliated firms are less financially constrained. The entrepreneur selects the optimal contract by trading-off these characteristics. The model allows several empirically testable predictions concerning the nature of projects financed by either type of venture capital firm. Entrepreneurs should seek capital from independent or affiliated venture capitalists contingent on the degree of sophistication of their project, their liquidation value, the importance of expected management support, and the remaining time to fundraising."

Drawing on a field study of 101 subsidiaries in Japan, we develop a contingency model that distinguishes between four different types of recontextualization with characteristic language policies and practices: developing/locally adaptive, developing/globally integrated, established/locally adaptive, and established/globally integrated. Our analysis shows how each of these four types is accompanied by specific problems and challenges. In particular, it elucidates five important aspects of language implementation: (1) the emergence of language praxis from the interplay of headquarters strategies and local responses; (2) the hybridization of language practices; (3) the central role of key actors such as subsidiary presidents in recontextualization; (4) the pervasive power implications of language policies and practices; and (5) the multifaceted implications for strategic human resource management. By so doing, our analysis opens up new avenues for context-specific and practice-oriented studies of language in multinational companies."

Show full details and related products Abstract:LEO is a French automotive equipment manufacturer, with 150 production sites in 30 countries around the world at the end of 2008. Since 2009, the automobile industry has been suffering from the financial crisis. LEO was seriously affected by the recession in Europe and the unprecedented volatility of commodity prices. The CEO decided to reorganize the structure in order to have saving in cost and adapt to the more demanding environment. LEO decided to establish a centralized procurement department in headquarters to plan and manage the entire purchasing activities for all production sites. Local purchasing departments were dismissed. The new procurement team was segmented by commodity, and a Commodity Management Team (CMT) was set up in order to hedge the commodity risk in the financial market. At the same time, LEO decided to reduce suppliers by 20% per year, and tried to increase the proportion of low cost countries sourcing from 60% to 80% in 2 years. After the reorganization, some new problems emerged in the newly centralized procurement department: coordination deteriorated between departments; quality and logistic issues became problematic due to Low Cost Countries Sourcing; and relationships with suppliers were hurt during the implementation of the centralized procurement structure. In this case, we try to discuss how to establish a procurement strategy to strengthen a company’s competitive advantages, and to show the importance of supplier relationship management."
Bian Dong,HUANG,01/11/2012,anglais,Naviga: How to compete in a more competitive market?,"Naviga Real Estate Group, founded in 1997, is a leading commercial property developer and operator in X, Jiangsu Province, China. The Group focuses on retail-focused commercial complexes and specialized markets. The founder, Mr Xu, is one of the Wenzhou folks who are famous for their acute business sense, money-making skills and hardworking. After dropping out of school at 16, Mr Xu first worked as a carpenter and just in two years, he made himself a master from the apprentice. However, he was so eager to have his own business that he started a small wooden toy factory, from which he made a small fortune. Later on, he quitted the business and picked up building material wholesaling. Such an experience provided him with precious insight into the specialized markets. Due to multiple drawbacks of traditional specialized markets, such as low operating efficiency, he was thinking of building his own specialized market. He located his first specialized market in City X in Southern Jiangsu Province, a city regarded as a center for hardware exchange. The business soon came into fruition, which earned him a big fortune. And at the same time, he found another business opportunity. The City X had a booming economy not only in urban areas but in towns. People in towns here were rather wealthy and eager to spend their money. The problem was that there were not sufficient commercial complexes in the urban areas. And also commercial complexes were basically non-existent in towns of City X, in particular large-scale commercial infrastructure for shopping, entertainment and recreation. This was a precious opportunity an acute business man couldn’t afford to miss. Mr Xu made heavy bet by investing in retail-focused commercial complexes including urban and town complexes and tourism-oriented food & beverage centers. Things had worked out pretty well at first. After a period of decent profiting, there are now headwinds likely to hold back Mr Xu's business. Key developers in China were basically more focused on residential properties. However, as China takes tightening measures around residential real estate and restricts bank loans, those developers are reshuffling and shifting to a more balanced portfolio. They start to get more and more involved in commercial real estate and tourism in wealthy tier-2 and tier-3 cities. Besides, foreign investors are acting as a forceful competitor with abundant experience, standardized development and operation and easy access to a large pool of capital. They also invest in REITs for stable returns. Though their focus is currently in tier-1 cities, their interests in China50 cities are increasing. Most of Mr Xu's businesses in commercial complexes are located in the towns of City X and tier-3 cities in Northern Jiangsu, which now are not subject to fierce competition. In fact, Naviga is very competitive in those towns and tier-cities. For the time being, Naviga is temporarily safe. However, there is no guarantee of continuous easy life for Mr Xu. Teaching objectives: Competitive strategies focus on ways in which a company can achieve the most advantageous position (Pearson, 1999). In order to help industries achieve competitive advantage, it is necessary to understand that industry competition is a function of the threat of new entrants, the threat of substitutes, the bargaining power of suppliers and buyers, and rivalry among existing competitors. From Porter's 5 forces, three generic strategies are available for companies: cost leadership, differentiation and focus. The three generic strategies suggested by Porter (1980, 1985) can be effectively utilized to defend against competition in the business environment. This case is suitable for use in an early section of a strategic management course, which introduces the students to the topic of industry analysis. Porter's Five Forces Model can be applied using the information provided. The industry analysis will enable students to recognize the dynamic and variable forces affecting the industry and evaluate the industry's attractiveness. An analysis of the structure of the industry should be undertaken in order to find effective sources of competitive advantage (Porter, 1985). It is also expected from students to identify the generic strategies, ie the possible sources of competitive advantage introduced by Porter: cost leadership, differentiation and focus."

HARGREAVES Dougal S.,MCVEY Nairn VINER,01/11/2012,anglais,The potential for current policy reforms in England to affect adolescent health,"Background Many of the foundations of lifelong health are laid in adolescence. In 2010, the English Department of Health launched a radical new public health strategy that aimed to improve all aspects of young people's health by promoting self-esteem, confidence, and personal responsibility. Previous research has emphasised the importance of social factors in adolescence, although finding no consistent relation between self-esteem and most health outcomes. We investigated the associations between health outcomes in adolescence and various individual and social factors. Methods Data from the UK national 2008 Healthy Foundations survey were accessed through the Department of Health. We analysed data for 452 participants aged 12–15 years, weighted to be nationally representative. From the survey we selected six individual-level factors, reflecting self-esteem, confidence, and personal responsibility; and seven societal factors, including measures of school, parental, home, peer, and community influence. For each factor, single-variable logistic regression models were used to calculate the odds ratios of seven health outcomes, adjusting for sex, age, and socioeconomic position (measured by Index of Multiple Deprivation score). Multivariable models were then created for each outcome, containing age, sex, deprivation, and all factors significant in the partially adjusted models. The health outcomes were self-reported general health, physical activity, healthy diet, healthy weight, and absence of smoking, alcohol use, and illicit drug use (all assessed with national guidelines for adolescents or standard definitions). Findings In the single-factor models, individual factors were linked to physical activity and healthy eating, but were not consistently linked to healthy weight and substance misuse. Positive social factors were associated with improved outcomes in all areas apart from alcohol use. In the multivariable model, improved general health was associated with living in a safe neighbourhood (adjusted odds ratio 1·4, 95% CI 1·0–1·9) as well as the individual factors of self-esteem (1·4, 1·0–1·8) and involvement in health (1·9, 1·3–2·6). Physical activity was similarly associated with self-esteem (1·5, 1·1–2·1) and involvement in health (1·4, 1·1–1·9), but with social participation in terms of social factors (1·9, 1·4–2·7). Healthy eating was associated only with the individual factor confidence (1·4, 1·1–1·7), with a trend for an association with school environment (1·3, 1·0–1·6). Being a healthy weight was not associated with any individual factors, and associated only with safe neighbourhood in terms of social factors (1·3, 1·1–1·7). Being a non-smoker was associated only with social factors, including parents not smoking (14·9, 4·5–49·4), ability to talk with parents (1·6, 1·1–2·5), living in a safe neighbourhood (1·7, 1·1–2·7), and school environment (2·3, 1·4–3·8). Drug use was associated with drug use at home (395, 9–16 918) and friends not being concerned about health (2·6, 1·7–4·0). Interpretation Individual factors such as self-esteem were associated with general health, physical activity, and healthy eating. However, the influence of family, peers, school, and local community seem to be equally important for these outcomes and more important for smoking, drug use, and healthy weight. Self-esteem interventions alone are unlikely to be successful in improving adolescent health, particularly in tackling obesity and reducing substance misuse. Funding The original survey was funded by the Department of Health; no specific funding was associated with the analysis and drafting of this study."

Using multiple case studies of the more established US and French STP facilities, they provide an analysis of the contributions made by STPs as regional drivers of innovative entrepreneurship. The paper concludes that successful STPs can act as platforms for incubating science and technology businesses. If modern STPs are to emerge as sustainable platforms of incubation, their business models must be responsive to changing contextual needs through the pursuit of realistic goals, providing high-quality value-added services, employing professionally competent management and maintaining financial strength."
Bertoni Fabio,Lugo,01/10/2012,anglais,Testing the Strategic Asset Allocation of Stabilization Sovereign Wealth Funds,"None of the models that have been developed to determine the optimal strategic asset allocation (SAA) of stabilization sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) has received direct empirical validation, primarily because there is a lack of transparency regarding some of the key parameters that characterize the problem. In this paper, building on a mean-variance framework, we derive three sets of parsimonious statistical tests to compare the actual SAA of SWFs to a theoretical optimum. We apply these tests to the portfolio of the world's largest stabilization SWF (the Norwegian Government Pension Fund - Global or GPF) for the period between 2002 and 2005. The empirical analysis confirms that the static and dynamic deviations of the GPF's SAA from the market equity portfolio are consistent with the theoretical predictions."
BROWN Dana,JETTE,01/10/2012,anglais,Managing corporate responsibility globally and locally,"Corporate Responsibility (CR) is today an essential component of corporate global strategy. CR can bolster the institutional context for market expansion (Porter and Kramer 2006); fill institutional voids (Tarun, et.al. 2005); or facilitate market entry as a component of non-market strategy (Baron 2006). Yet, in fulfilling these functions, CR may need to be highly sensitive to local contexts. How can transnational firms organize CR so as to maximize efficiencies from globalization and to minimize the fragmentation of corporate organizational cultures? Bartlett and Ghoshal (1989) provide a framework for analyzing the way that corporations coordinate global and local functions. We build on this framework in a case study of Novo Nordisk and its approach to determining global and local CR policies and procedures with regard to its China and United States subsidiaries. Our findings suggest that it is important for companies to define a common set of organizational norms. In addition, CR need to be sensitive to local institutional contexts, but learning from subsidiary experience is important and lends itself to standardization and replication of initiatives across market contexts."

GERGES YAMMINE Rand,Guedri,01/10/2012,anglais,When Alliances Make a Difference,"This study investigates how the interaction between strategic group membership and network of alliances influences firm performance. We argue that the effects of density of ties and role equivalence on firm performance matters more for members of strategic groups protected by the highest mobility barriers in the industry than for members of strategic groups ranking lower on the mobility barriers spectrum. We test our hypotheses in the context of the international airline industry over the period 1996-2010. Our findings indicate that the network of alliances impacts the performance of strategic group members asymmetrically. The higher the mobility barriers protecting the group, the stronger the performance benefits of alliance networks."

Based on a total rewards perspective that includes monetary as well as non-monetary rewards, we develop a framework that explains how the composition and effectiveness of both rewards elements change over the life cycle of a new venture. Our paper suggests that as new ventures grow and overcome their liabilities of newness and smallness, they gradually shift their emphasis from non-monetary rewards to monetary rewards elements and from incentive compensation to fixed pay."
Lipuma Joseph,,01/10/2012,anglais,Too Much of a Good Thing?,"Drawing on insights from the resource-based view and institutional theory, we examine how functional-type alliances, alliances with large industry partners, CVC, and interactions between alliances and CVC influence international intensity. Initial results support the notion that alliances and CVC appear to be supplements, rather than complements, which has important implications for resource-constrained new ventures evaluating different types of partnerships. We extend research on the identification of resources relating to and the effect of different types of partnerships on new-venture internationalization behavior, and we provide insights for entrepreneurs evaluating international strategies."
Ruble Richard,Versaevel,01/10/2012,anglais,On the tacit collusion equilibria of a dynamic duopoly investment game,"This note extends the characterization of simultaneous investment (tacit collusion) equilibria in Boyer, Lasserre and Moreaux (2012). Tacit collusion equilibria may or may not exist, and when they do may involve either finite time investments (type 1) or infinite delay (type 2). The relationship between equilibria and common demand forms is not immediately apparent. We provide the full necessary and sufficient conditions for existence. A simple condition on demand primitives is derived that determines the type of equilibria. Common demand forms are then shown to illustrate both finite-time and infinite-delay tacit collusion."
Silberzahn Chittima,Guedri,01/10/2012,anglais,CEO Career horizon and firm diversification,"The CEO career horizon is one of important factors influencing their strategic decision making for the firm. Building upon prospect theory and agency theory, we posit that CEOs approaching retirement will be reluctant to engage in increased diversification and more likely to initiate refocusing strategies. Moreover, we suggest that structure of control, displayed by the ratio of independent directors and CEO duality, moderates the impact of CEO career horizon such that the stronger the structure of control the lower the effect of career horizon on diversification and refocusing strategies. We test our hypotheses using a sample of firms belonging to the FTSE 100 during1997-2010. Our findings lend support to our theses."

PECHER M.,Prange,01/09/2012,anglais,TPresso : The Tea Machine War is Just Beginning in China,"The case begins before the launch of TPresso in China in 2011. TPresso is an automated tea system produced by the Swiss company Monodor. It builds on the success story of Nespresso in the coffee capsule market and now introduces a high-end tea machine that uses capsules in order to make tea. Monodor was founded in 1991 by Eric Favre. Eric originally invented Nespresso coffee capsules for Nestle in 1976, but then left the company to start its own business. Having successfully developed the idea of the tea capsule, Eric and his wife Anna-Maria decided to launch the Tpresso capsule first in China, ie, before entering their Swiss home market. One of the biggest challenges in China will be to 'revolutionize' tea consumption. Apart from these cultural challenges that affect consumer behavior, Monodor needs to develop its marketing strategy to succeed in China. The case can be used for graduate students who have already been exposed to the essentials of marketing. It is equally suitable for courses in international marketing, luxury marketing, and consumer behavior, especially with an Asian focus."

Vaara Eero,Faÿ,01/09/2012,anglais,Reproduction and Change on the Global Scale,"Despite a proliferation of critical studies on management education, there is a paucity of knowledge of the ways in which problematic beliefs, values, and practices are reproduced in and through management education. By drawing on and extending Bourdieu's seminal work, this paper offers a new perspective on reproduction on the global scale. Our framework spans three inter-related levels of analysis: the dominant beliefs, values, and practices (nomos and doxa) of management in global society; the structuration of the field of management education on a global scale; and the prevailing pedagogical practices in management education programmes. Our analysis adds to critical studies of management education by elucidating the overwhelming institutional forces of reproduction and thus explaining how difficult it is to effect change in the prevailing ideas, values, and practices. Unlike most critical analyses, we also explain how change might take place and what it would require. Thus, our analysis advances studies of reproduction in this era of globalization more generally. It also provides an example of how Bourdieusian ideas can be applied and expanded upon in novel ways in research on education in general and management education in particular."

Drawing on a longitudinal historical analysis of a new-born industry in an emerging economy, we examine catching up at the sub-industry group level. We identify three catching up patterns: intra-group of domestic firms, intra-group of foreign firms and inter-group dynamics. We develop a-five-stage model illustrating the industry evolution with catching up as the underling logic. Our analysis adds to catching up literature by providing a new level of analysis: sub-industry group. It also extends the research of catching up with theoretical insights from a low technology industry and opens up new possibilities for the research domain."
Cajaiba-Santana Giovany,,01/08/2012,anglais,The concept of non economic value in social entrepreneurship ventures,Social entrepreneurship has been frequently present as a source of social value creation as opposed to economic entrepreneurship which would be a source of economic value. However the idea of value commoly used in organizational research comes from neo-classic economy and is equivalent to marginal utiliy. We argue here that this paradigm of value do not encompass the idea of non economic value created by social ventures. We undertake a historical review of the concept of value on economy and organizational research and we propose a new model of conceiving non ecomic value based on the neo-institutional scholl of economy.

In this paper, we review the dominant paradigms in contemporary nonmarket research and report on the key insights and findings from those perspectives. We use this review to suggest that the integration of institutional and strategic perspectives provides a logical path for the continued development of nonmarket strategy research going forward. Looking ahead, our premise is that institutional perspectives will have an increased relevance to nonmarket scholarship, particularly with the increasing importance of emergent economies to international business. As companies are required to invest more in nonmarket practices, and adapt those practices to unique country contexts, we anticipate that research will increasingly draw from multiple conceptual paradigms and perspectives."

Drawing on a large sample of European airlines over the period 2002 -2006, we provide empirical support for the inverted U-shaped relationship between multi-territory contact and rivalry as reflected by entries into and exits from the territory of a competitor. We conclude that competition between firms exhibits successive periods of rivalry and forbearance, possibly independently of time and institutional settings."

Building on data from rural Bangladesh and analyzing the work of a prominent intermediary organization, we uncover institutional voids as the source of market exclusion and identify two sets of activities – redefining market architecture and legitimating new actors – as critical for building ‘inclusive’ markets. We expose voids as ‘analytical spaces’ and illustrate how they result from conflict and contradiction among institutional ‘bits and pieces’ from local political, community, and religious spheres. Our findings put forward a perspective on market building that highlights the ‘on the ground’ dynamics and attends to the ‘institutions at play’, to their consequences, and to a more diverse set of ‘inhabitants’ of institutions."

Only in recent years, scholars have begun to pay attention to the stakeholder management concept in relation to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The few existing studies in this area, however, discuss SMEs as a context free category or remain focused on single country analysis. This cross-national empirical research investigates SME owner–managers’ perceptions of stakeholder management in six European countries. The comparative analysis is followed by a discussion of how institutional, cultural and linguistic contexts can influence owner–managers’ sensemaking of stakeholder management. Our study questions the universality of specific management terms and proposes that more attention should be paid to the institutional, cultural and linguistic environments that shape economic activity in different parts of Europe."
Bertoni Fabio,Croce Guerini,01/07/2012,anglais,The effectiveness of public venture capital in supporting the investments of European young high-tech companies,"This work studies the extent to which the investments of young high-tech companies in Europe are supported by public venture capital (PVC) financing. We estimate an investment equation derived from a sales accelerator model, and benchmark PVC to the most well-known category of venture capital: independent venture capital (IVC). To take into account unobserved firm heterogeneity and the endogenous nature of VC financing, we resort to a system generalized method of moments (SYS-GMM) including external instruments for PVC and IVC variables. The sample includes a panel of 1,312 young high-tech manufacturing companies from six European countries. Our results confirm that European young high-tech companies are financially constrained and that IVC is effective both in increasing firm's investments and in alleviating their dependence on current cash flows. The impact of PVC is, instead, very limited. PVC-backed firms increase their investments right after a financing round, but no effect is observed in the long term. Moreover the investments of PVC-backed firms are still affected by their current cash flows."

This allows us to ask whether standard classes of utility functions, such as those inspired by Kihlstrom and Mirman (1974) [16], Selden (1978) [27], Epstein and Zin (1989) [10] and Quiggin (1982) [25] are well ordered in terms of risk aversion. Moreover, opting for this model-free approach allows us to establish new general results on the impact of risk aversion on savings behaviors. In particular, we show that risk aversion enhances precautionary savings, clarifying the link that exists between the notions of prudence and risk aversion."
Bouchard Véronique,Del Forno,01/07/2012,anglais,The future of management as design,"Purpose – Management practices and education are presently in a stage of reappraisal and a growing number of scholars and experts are suggesting that managers should be taught and adopt the approach and methodologies of designers. The purpose of this paper is to imagine the impact of this move and to try and foresee whether “management as design” is an inescapable evolution or just another management fad. Design/methodology/approach – Once the notion of management as design is defined, a thought experiment is proposed to the reader under the guise of a forged business case whose various implications are progressively exposed and discussed. Findings – The adoption of a design approach holds profound transformative potential for the positioning, offer, value chain and processes of firms but it also implies a substantial re-arranging of the relations between co-workers, and between managers and subordinates. Beyond the initial shock that the introduction of a radically different approach inevitably entails, management as design is exposed to three perils: the reduction of design approaches and methods to a mere set of tools in the hands of self-appointed experts; the rejection of its open-ended and inclusive methods on account of their lengthy and time-consuming nature; the inherently hard-to-manage relations between traditional managers, on the one hand, and managers as designers, on the other. Originality/value – The article uses the power of a fictional narrative to explore and draw some of the firm-level and individual-level implications of the adoption of “management as design” approaches and methodologies by a hypothetical company."

Although firms are expected to benefit from increasing diversity of alliance portfolio resources, the performance effects could vary with types of diversity of alliance portfolio resources. Further, performance effects may depend on a focal firm’s characteristics. By analyzing a sample of US semiconductor firms, we show that diversity of alliance functions positively affects firm’s market performance, while high diversity of technological and positional resources has a negative effect on firm performance. However, this negative effect depends on a focal firm’s market experience."
KNUDSEN Jette Steen,BROWN,01/07/2012,anglais,Novo Nordisk: Managing Sustainability at Home and Abroad,"AWARD WINNING CASE - Corporate Social Responsibility Award, 2012 European Foundation for Management Development (EFMD) Case Writing Competition. This case study deals with the opportunities and challenges faced by Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk with regard to its sustainability approach in China as of 2012. Novo Nordisk is well known for striving to integrate its business activities in a financially, environmentally, and socially responsible way, and many Novo Nordisk employees proudly refer to Novo Nordisk as a “triple bottom line (TBL) company.” Novo Nordisk has been active in China for more than 50 years; however, since the Chinese economy has expanded tremendously, this increase in wealth and a more sedentary Western lifestyle have led to growing problems with obesity. As a result, China’s insulin market is booming. Novo Nordisk therefore faces new challenges concerning how best to organize its TBL program in a way that ensures a comprehensive approach throughout the organization, yet allows Novo Nordisk China to adopt initiatives that fit the Chinese business context. Furthermore, with ever-increasing competition for access to China’s lucrative insulin market, Novo Nordisk’s competitors are also engaging in sustainability, which means that Novo Nordisk must keep innovating to stand out, and must use sustainability as a source of competitive advantage.Learning Objective:The case was written to help students develop skills in analyzing the potential strategic purposes of sustainability when applied to a global business context. The case focuses both on internal organization issues in a multinational organization, as well as on how to develop a sustainability strategy in a highly competitive business context in China. It also raises some general issues in terms of how to organize initiatives across a large global company and how to stand out from competitors. Students can work on the development of an integrated strategy for Novo Nordisk, discussing the political and social issues that must be addressed in any market entry to China."
Lipuma Joseph,,01/07/2012,anglais,Internationalization and the IPO performance of new ventures,"This study of the relationship between internationalization and IPO performance examines 184 privately held venture capital-backed U.S. technology-based new ventures. Internationalization subjects new ventures to high agency risks, as communication and monitoring of activities become more difficult. Yet, foreign activities can enhance resource stocks of new ventures via market knowledge and coordination capabilities. The study finds that solely domestic new ventures receive higher valuations at initial public offerings (IPOs) than do new ventures with a high proportion of foreign sales. This conclusion informs that investors perceive that agency risks outweigh the possible benefits of enhanced resource endowments from foreign activities. In addition, high international intensity new ventures execute IPOs later than solely domestic ventures. As IPOs are the primary means by which investors receive a return on their investments, this finding has significant implications for entrepreneurs seeking capital and for their investors."

These companies implemented the same ERP system in a similar time span (though not at the same time). They are two very large Chinese State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and in this paper we highlight the centralization versus decentralization debate relating to IS-IT as this issue is proved particularly important in this specific context of Chinese SOEs. The first company went from a decentralized strategy towards a centralized one. Conversely, the second company went from a centralized strategy towards a decentralized one. Despite these differences, both companies successfully completed the projects with dissimilar mixed strategies."
Rekik Yacine,SAHIN,01/07/2012,anglais,Exploring inventory systems sensitive to shrinkage – analysis of a periodic review inventory under a service level constraint,"Motivated by empirical evidence, this article focuses on the behaviour of a store inventory exposed to inventory record inaccuracy. The inventory, controlled by an infinite horizon, single-stage, single-product periodic-review policy, is subject to shrinkage errors that cause a difference between the physical and information system inventory levels. We model a set of scenarios depending on the technology available to track shrinkage in the store. In scenarios where a technology such as Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) is not used, inventory is controlled by estimating the expected shrinkage rate. We assume that an inspection process is performed at a regular frequency of N selling periods. We analyse two situations that permit management of the joint ordering and inspection policy based on the information the inventory manager has on shrinkage errors. A comparison between these two situations permits us to analyse the impact of shrinkage errors and the value of taking into account the inventory inaccuracy issue when optimising the inventory and inspection policies. The deployment of the RFID technology produces two benefits: total visibility of the shrinkage rate and the elimination of shrinkage errors. A comparison of the scenarios enables us to evaluate the economic impact of inventory record inaccuracies, which can be significant, particularly in systems with a poor estimation of the error parameter as well as with a high inspection cost."
Vaara Eero,Whittington,01/07/2012,anglais,Strategy as practice,"This article reviews research in Strategy-as-Practice (SAP) and suggests directions for its development. The power of this perspective lies in its ability to explain how strategy-making is enabled and constrained by prevailing organizational and societal practices. Our review shows how SAP research has helped to advance social theories in strategic management, offered alternatives to performance-dominated analyzes, broadened the scope in terms of organizations studied and promoted new methodologies. In particular, it has provided important insights into the tools and methods of strategy-making (practices), how strategy work takes place (praxis), and the role and identity of the actors involved (practitioners). However, we argue that there is a need to go further in the analysis of social practices to unleash the full potential of this perspective. Hence, we outline five directions for the further development of the practice perspective: placing agency in a web of practices, recognizing the macro-institutional nature of practices, focusing attention on emergence in strategy-making, exploring how the material matters, and promoting critical analysis."

Alperovych Yan,Amess Wright,01/06/2012,anglais,Private Equity Firm Experience and Buy-out Vendor Source,"Using a dataset comprising 102 private equity (PE) backed leveraged buyouts (LBOs) completed and exited during the period 1999-2008, this study sheds new light on the impact of buyout vendor source and PE investor experience on post-buyout efficiency during the first three years after the transaction. There are three main findings. First, we observe increases in post-buyout efficiency over time, although LBOs from different vendor source differ in terms of post-transaction efficiency levels and improvement trajectories. Private buyouts are about as efficient as the average. Divisional buyouts show highest efficiency levels overall. Secondary buyouts remain below the average. Second, multivariate analyses suggest a positive and significant effect of PE firm experience on post-buyout efficiency. Finally, the observed efficiency patterns seem to be convex, suggesting the major improvements happen in the first two years after the transaction."
Bernard Carole,Le Courtois,01/06/2012,anglais,Asset Risk Management of Participating Contracts,"In this paper we study the asset-liability management of an insurance company selling participating contracts"". Participating contracts are typical insurance policies sold in Europe, in Japan or in North America. The payoff of a participating policy is linked to the portfolio and the surplus of the insurance company. We examine the impact of the choice of the assets' investment strategy on the company value, its solvency and how well the company may meet the commitments associated with its liabilities. Our goal is to exhibit an investment strategy matching as much as possible assets and liabilities at their market value and complying with existing regulation constraints. It is then shown that a dynamic CPPI strategy can significantly reduce the default probability of the company, and increase the policyholders contracts' market values. Consequently our study also shows that the valuation of participating policies and the determination of fair contracts should not be done neglecting the impact of the choice of the assets' allocation strategy."""

Advances in multi-level modeling allow increased precision in quantitative international business (IB) research, and open up new methodological and conceptual possibilities. However, they create new challenges, and they are still not frequently used in IB research. In this editorial we outline some key methodological issues for the uses of MLM in IB, including criteria, sample size, and measure equivalence issues. We then examine promising directions for future multilevel IB research considering comparative opportunities at nation, multiple-nation cluster, and within-nation region levels, including large multilevel databases. We also consider its promise for MNE research about semi-globalization, interorganizational effects across nations, clusters within nations, and teams and subsidiaries within MNEs."

BUTTGEN Marion,SCHUMANN Ates,01/05/2012,anglais,Service Locus of Control and Customer Coproduction,"Customer coproduction is highly relevant for service firms and has attracted significant academic attention. Whereas prior research has addressed several drivers of customer coproduction behavior, such as motivation, ability, or knowledge, it has hardly addressed the role of customer control beliefs or their drivers. This research proposes that specific beliefs about the service locus of control (SLOC) influence coproduction behaviors and that SLOC beliefs themselves depend on customers' prior comparable reinforcement experiences and the socialization activities of the service provider. The test of the proposed model includes 2,679 customers of a service firm that provides health-related strength training, a context that relies heavily on coproduction. The results show that SLOC beliefs, especially customers' internal SLOC, drive coproduction. Service providers can influence internal SLOC with organizational socialization activities, particularly when the customer possesses prior experience with the service provider. Prior comparable reinforcement experiences are less relevant drivers though, which emphasizes the importance of proactive, repeated socialization activities by service providers."
Courpasson David,Dany Clegg,01/05/2012,anglais,Resisters at work,"Research has recognized the transformative dimension of resistance in the workplace. Yet resistance is still seen as an adversarial and antagonistic process that management can accept or reject; thus, understanding how resistance can actually influence workplace change remains a challenge for research. In this paper, we offer an analysis of two situations of resistance wherein resisters, organized in temporary enclaves, are able to influence top management’s decisions and produce eventual change. Whether or not resistance becomes productive depends on the skillful work of resisters and the creation of powerful “objects of resistance” that enable resisters to modify temporarily the power configuration of a situation and oblige top management to listen to their claims and accommodate to the new configuration. This paper shows that resistance can be better explained by what resisters do to achieve their ends rather than by seeing resistance as a fixed opposition between irreconcilable adversaries."
Crespin-Mazet Florence,Scheid Goglio-primard,01/05/2012,anglais,The role of third parties in open innovation processes,"This paper aims at better understanding the managerial and organizational factors (structures, actors involved, knowledge management systems) leading firms to engage into open innovation projects. After a literature review on open innovation in the software industry, it reviews the role of proximity in the organization of innovation processes. Based on the analysis of two case studies in the proprietary software industry (one exploitation and one exploration innovation case), this paper confirms that spatial proximity may be a favorable but not a sufficient condition to generate the success of open innovation projects. The development of socioeconomic proximity including both coordination and resource-based proximity comes across as a key success factor. The analysis reveals that a third party can play a decisive role in fostering socio-economic proximity between partners. These third parties can be considered as tertius iungens in Obstfeld’s sense (2005). The paper highlights some differences between the exploration and the exploitation case. The managerial and organizational levers activated by these tertius iungens to overcome the barriers to open innovation vary in each case. The paper draws implications for local governance (territorial animation) and network management for start-up firms."
Le Courtois Olivier,Menoncin,01/05/2012,anglais,Management of Pension Funds under Market Jump Risk,"We solve the optimal portfolio problem of a pension fund maximizing the expected present value of the remaining wealth at the death time of a representative subscriber. The fund can invest in a risky and a riskless asset. Both contributions and pensions are assumed to be constant, while risky asset returns are modeled by a general L´evy process. Assuming a CRRA utility function, we are able to obtain a quasi-closed-form formula for optimal weights. In order to solve fully a portfolio/pension fund problem with L´evy processes, it is necessary to switch back and forth between the stochastic differential and the standard exponential representations. We develop this procedure, and then illustrate it with two dynamics: the Variance Gamma process and a process introduced by A¨ıt-Sahalia, Cacho-Diaz, and Hurd (2009). We compute the optimal portfolio fund allocation in these two sub-settings and in the standard mean-variance framework. We show that when market stylized features (i.e. asymmetry, leptokurtosis and jumps) are suitably taken into account, the optimal portfolio share in the risky asset may be around half that obtained in the mean-variance framework."

Based on a sample of 347 French women exposed to either idealized or ""nonidealized"" models, the authors established that the way these advertising models have an effect on brand responses-specifically, the attitude toward (and the purchase intention of) a brand-operates through a dual-process model.When a viewer had a high sense of self-esteem, it was crucial that both processes be understood simultaneously: the effect of the portrayed model's body image on the brand responses can be suppressed by the model-evaluation process.

Bertoni Fabio,D'Adda Grilli,01/03/2012,anglais,Cherry Picking or Frog Kissing? The Matching Process between Investors and Entrepreneurial Ventures in Thin Venture Capital Markets,"In this paper we explore the matching process between entrepreneurs and investors in thin venture capital (VC) markets. We develop a simple theoretical model of the two-step matching process between entrepreneurs and investors in which VC is in extremely scarce supply and firms have to incur an entry cost to actively seek it. The model explains why in thin VC markets: (i) VC might not be attracted by the best-performing companies (“cherry picking”) but by the companies that need it most (“frog kissing”), and (ii) even if the number of companies that could potentially benefit from VC is very high, the actual deal flow for VC could be meager. We empirically test the predictions of the “frog kissing” equilibrium through survey-based data (RITA directory) collected in 2004 on a sample of 202 New Technology-Based Firms (NTBFs) that operate in Italy. The empirical evidence supports the “frog kissing” argument. First, entry costs and the degree of development of the VC market are both found to substantially affect the likelihood of a NTBF to actively seek VC. Second, NTBFs financed by VC are the least endowed with complementary assets."
Courpasson David,Golsorkhi Sallaz,01/03/2012,anglais,"Rethinking Power in Organizations, Institutions, and Markets","Power and domination once occupied center stage in organizational sociology. But as the field developed, the concept of power was marginalized and its overall significance for the drama of organization life neglected. Normative critiques of domination were recast as puzzles of obedience to authority, while scholars wishing to study the concrete workings of power regimes found themselves groping in the shadows. In this introduction, we advocate putting power and domination back on the agenda. Following the lead of classical theorists of power, we argue that organizations should be seen as scenes of struggles and as political projects to be constantly achieved and reconstructed. We critique structural and abstract perspectives that neglect the constant engagement of people in the negotiation of rules, meanings, and destinies. And we survey novel ideas that can help us to see power not as an abstract entity but as a pattern of interactions and social relationships that is instantiated in specific projects of domination and resistance. It is through this lens that power studies can be reinvigorated."
Courpasson David,Clegg,01/03/2012,anglais,The Polyarchic Bureaucracy,"Many bureaucracies still exist, and not just in the public sector. Increasingly, however, we would argue that they are more likely to evolve towards polyarchic forms because of the growing centrality of stakeholder resistance, especially that which is premised on empowerment of key employees. We suggest that managerial responses to this resistance are transforming bureaucracies through process of accommodation: upper echelon managers invent responses to contentious acts and voices so as to reintegrate ‘resisters’ while rewarding them for contesting decisions in a cooperative way. Understanding these processes help us understand why traditional bureaucracy is currently transforming itself as a result of the emergence of new forms of resistance in the workplace."

As a result, we can rank 127 countries with respect to their FDI attraction. The measure allows detailed strength and weakness analyses and enhances the discussion of why FDI flows are concentrated in advanced economies. Additionally, the findings reveal the areas in which emerging countries should improve in order to narrow existing gaps. Our robustness checks indicate that the composite measure accurately tracks real FDI activity."
Nairn Agnès,CLARKE,01/03/2012,anglais,Researching children,"As the role of children in society becomes more prominent, their participation in research seems set to increase. In this paper we review whether we are getting the ethics of children's research right. We show that, since the late 1980s, children have been treated universally as a special case and that they have been accorded their own special set of human rights (UNCRC), which primarily grants them rights to protection and participation. We go on to argue (with practical examples) that the core MRS research principles of well-being, voluntary informed consent and privacy/confidentiality must be applied to children with particular caution and care. We note that, as research with children grows and as new techniques are developed, we are presented with fresh challenges for keeping children safe and maintaining their trust. We end by presenting the results of a survey that sought children's views on being research participants in a quite sensitive piece of research. We found that children are highly appreciative of being consulted about their lives in general and being asked about their feelings. However we also found that some children can be uncomfortable with some of the issues raised and can feel compelled to answer the questions. We conclude that, while we have good industry codes, ethics evolves with shifting social, political and cultural patterns, and we need to keep challenging ourselves to maintain best practice."

Lawton Thomas,Doh SCHOTTER,01/02/2012,anglais,Airasia X: Can the low cost model go long haul?,"By 2007, AirAsia had become one of the most successful budget airlines in the world. Having conquered Southeast Asia, and entered China and India, AirAsia was poised to solidify its place as one of the foremost budget airlines and one of the most consistently profitable globally. But company founder Tony Fernandes had bigger plans. From the outset in 2001, Fernandes had intended to offer long haul service, competing against the largest and most established airlines in the world. However, his advisors had urged him to focus on regional, short to medium distance service. With many successes under his belt, Fernandes was once again ready to tackle long haul. Despite persistent claims from industry insiders that low cost long haul flights would never be profitable, Fernandes pushed forward with the expansion. Hiring 36-year-old Azran Osman-Rani as the CEO for the new long haul venture, nicknamed X, was a critical step in this process. X’s inaugural flight to Australia took place in November 2007. In early 2010, X received its eleventh aircraft and was flying to 15 destinations on three continents. However, over time the substantial differences between long haul and short haul operating requirements became more apparent. Consequently, the management decided to formally separate X from AirAsia. This separation, and the inherent challenges for X and its recently appointed head of Commercial Operations, Darren Wright included: (1) how best to leverage the extensive network of the regional sister company AirAsia in selecting new and profitable destinations for X, (2) how to increase revenues without raising ticket prices, (3) how best to globally position the airline’s brand in non-Asian markets, (4) how to shift his marketing team’s mentality away from a start-up mindset, and (5) how to prepare for a global initial public offering within the next 12 months.Learning Objective:This case is designed primarily for use in full-time and executive MBA program modules on strategic management, international strategy, strategic marketing management, entrepreneurship or business policy. It could also be used in more specialized masters programs that focus on strategy or marketing, or for senior undergraduate classes in strategic management, strategic marketing management and international business.

Bonini Stefano,ALKAN Salvi,01/01/2012,anglais,The Effects of Venture Capitalists on the Governance of Firms,"Research Question/Issue: What determines venture capitalists influence on the governance of firms? How do venture capitalists shape the governance of their investees? Are venture capitalists governance practices consistent across countries? These important questions are under-investigated in the extant literature. In this study, we shed light on the effects of venture capital investors on a large set of governance decisions and we discover the existence of striking cross-country differences. Research Findings/Insights: We test our conjectures on a unique hand-collected questionnaire-based dataset of 164 companies in five countries and two regions (Europe and the US). Our empirical results show that there is a strong and positive relationship between VCs' funding and their influence on some factors like decisions on CEO hiring, executive compensation, board decisions and appointments. Employee incentives are also positively related to the proportion of VC funding. On the other hand, results show that the proportion of VC funding is only marginally significant in explaining VC influence on strategy direction and investment planning. Our analysis though, offers a remarkably different view after splitting data into European and American subsamples. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our results provide a novel view of the functioning of the Venture Capital industry and its degree of pervasiveness in the management of portfolio companies. Adopting a unique dataset, we add new evidence on detailed governance decisions, thus supporting the idea that the incremental contribution of a professional investor to a new venture is largely exceeding the capital infusion only. Finally, we show that governance decisions exhibit significant country effects. This evidence supports the view that a global theory of corporate governance cannot rely on a single interpretation framework such as agency theory, but needs to be integrated with predictions from alternative views such institutional theory. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Corporate governance is the essential mechanism allowing proper management of financial and corporate resources by aligning incentives of employees and investors, thus enabling oversight and control on companies. Yet, corporate governance rules and mechanisms are costly and have different effectiveness across countries. Our results provide guidance to investors in selecting the appropriate set of governance provisions conditional on a set of investment-specific factors."
CALAMEL Ludivine,Defélix Picq Retour,01/01/2012,anglais,Inter-organisational projects in French innovation clusters,"Having received considerable attention from central government and local authorities, French innovation clusters (the so-called ‘pôles de compétitivité’) are beginning to be studied by academic researchers and evaluated by consultants. The core of their activity consists of collaborative projects, which are characterised by specific management and Human Resources practices located at the junction of different cultures and employment statuses. Almost four years after they were launched, what can we say about the dynamic of these collaborative projects? What is the reality of such collaboration when it involves multiple partnerships bringing together employees from different occupational cultures and Human Resources Management systems? The aim of this longitudinal research, which is based on the observation of two collaborative projects in one of the most largest clusters in France, is to discuss management and HR issues in such a setting. A literature review highlights the need to open up the ‘black box’ of collaboration within projects and encourages examination of both manager's coordination efforts and the actors' motivation to cooperate, as well as the role played by HRM practices. Thus observation of the conduct of the projects over two years reveals that collaboration, far from being a given within these projects, is the product of a process of social construction that might be fostered by better managerial support."
Gong Yeming,Yucesan,01/01/2012,anglais,Stochastic optimization for transshipment problems with positive replenishment lead times,"Transshipments, monitored movements of material at the same echelon of a supply chain, represent an effective pooling mechanism. Earlier papers dealing with transshipments either do not incorporate replenishment lead times into their analysis, or only provide a heuristic algorithm where optimality cannot be guaranteed beyond settings with two locations. This paper uses infinitesimal perturbation analysis by combining with a stochastic approximation method to examine the multi-location transshipment problem with positive replenishment lead times. It demonstrates the computation of optimal base stock quantities through sample path optimization. From a methodological perspective, this paper deploys a duality-based gradient computation method to improve computational efficiency. From an application perspective, it solves transshipment problems with non-negligible replenishment lead times. A numerical study illustrates the performance of the proposed approach."
Lawton Thomas,Rajwani Reinmoeller,01/01/2012,anglais,Do you have a survival instinct?,"It is too easy to blame market turbulence or unexpected events for a company's poor performance; yet, this is frequently the response of managers to circumstances and activities beyond their immediate control. As a consequence, managers and owners often fail to develop strategies for coping with challenge or crisis the next time it occurs. The result is that many organizations are doomed to repeat the same or similar mistakes over and over again in a form of corporate déjà vu. To gain insights regarding how companies can better manage in hostile environments, we consider the solutions that have evolved in nature over billions of years. We trace nature's codes for adapting to hostile environments and explore the underlying characteristics of four genetic code types that can help business organizations to offset the negative implications of hostility through ensuring strategic fit. We then link the four genetic codes most frequently found in nature with organizational capabilities. When correctly identified and leveraged, these capabilities can enable a company to focus attention and resources on how to manage successfully in hostile environments."

RIAD Sally,Vaara ZHANG,01/01/2012,anglais,The intertextual production of international relations in mergers and acquisitions,"While studies on international management have focused on cultural differences and examined institutional specificities in various national business systems, conceptions of international relations have been left relatively underexplored. We argue that representations of international relations are relevant to international M&As and contend that intertextuality offers a novel approach to examine these relational features of international management. Our analysis focuses on Sino–US relations in the context of the acquisition of American IBM’s Personal Computer Division (PCD) by the Chinese company, Lenovo. We demonstrate the ways in which facets of international relations are produced in media accounts of this acquisition, and analyse the intertextual dynamics entwined with their production. The analysis consists of three sections: constitutive intertextuality, manifest intertextuality and intertextual ideological undercurrents. These illustrate the variation in producing international relations through discursive themes (threat to security/peaceful rise), emotion rhetoric (fear/cheer) and ideology (cold war/globalism). In summary, the paper elucidates the ways in which international M&As are immersed in a seascape of intertextual international relations."
Vaara Eero,Sarala STAHL Bjorkman,01/01/2012,anglais,The impact of organizational and national cultural differences on social conflict and knowledge transfer in international acquisitions,"The purpose of this paper is to elucidate the effects of organizational and national cultural differences on international acquisitions. We argue that cultural differences prompt social identity building that leads to ‘us versus them’ thinking and thereby creates the potential for social conflict. We also maintain that the same cultural differences can contribute to learning in terms of knowledge transfer. We develop a structural equation model to test these hypothesized effects on a sample of related international acquisitions. Our analysis shows that cultural differences at the organizational level are positively associated with social conflict, but that national cultural differences can decrease social conflict. Furthermore, both organizational and national cultural differences are positively associated with knowledge transfer. This analysis shows the importance of disentangling the various effects that cultural differences have on international acquisitions. It also suggests that national cultural differences are less of a problem in international acquisitions than is usually assumed."
COGET Jean-François,Haag GIBSON,01/12/2011,anglais,Anger and fear in decision-making,"Anger and fear are frequently felt and impactful workplace emotions, especially in times of crisis when critical decisions need to be made. An important question is how these emotions might influence decision makers’ depth of processing: whether when feeling angry or fearful decision-makers engage in more conscious and analytical rational decision making, or less-conscious and heuristic intuitive decision making. To date research on the effect of these strong emotions has been limited to laboratory studies where the complexity and pressures of real-world managerial decisions are absent, and focused on generalized mood rather than on direct emotional experience. This study asks two research questions: Do anger and fear facilitate the use of intuitive or rational decision-making? And what is the impact of these emotions on decision effectiveness? We examine these phenomena in the crisis-laden field setting of film directors actively engaged in directing motion pictures. Data were gathered by shadowing and interviewing seven film directors. A qualitative analysis of the video and audio transcripts revealed that film directors engage in two types of intuitive decision-making, based on whether the decision was driven by expertise or personal emotional experience. Rational decision-making occurred when directors, driven by feelings of moderate fear and little previous experience with a situation, relied on a more conscious, deliberative decision-making process. Four types of decision effectiveness are identified: task, personal, growth, and leadership. The implications of emotion-driven decision-making on each of these types of effectiveness are explored."

Once it would always have been his eldest son, but increasingly women are becoming involved in family firms having risen to positions of influence and leadership. Using revealing case studies from the daughters who succeeded their entrepreneur fathers in a wide variety of challenging situations, cultures and continents, Father-Daughter Succession in Family Business"" discusses the changes which have led to daughters gaining influence in more and more family businesses. It looks at the tensions this succession can produce between old notions of how men and women should behave, and the new style of leadership that often comes about when a woman takes the helm. This book will help consultants, business educators, and researchers, as well as those who are themselves involved in significant family managed enterprises to better understand why it can no longer be assumed in any part of the World that the first born son will take over the reins of the family business."""

The Adaptation-Aggregation- Arbitrage (AAA) triangle summarizes these options and suggests that the more firms balance the three strategies, the greater the success they experience in internationalization. We extend this AAA framework by investigating the role of customer participation. Based on a review of the relevant literature, we identify three stages of customer influence, i.e., customization, co-creation, and co-formation (CCC). These are used to develop a combined framework of AAA-CCC strategies. Four case examples illustrate that some combinations are more likely to yield success than others."
Dattée Brice,Autio,01/11/2011,anglais,Externalities and control mechanisms in business ecosystems,"In distributed contexts, firms face a dilemma between value creation through leveraging externalities and value appropriation through maintaining “control”. This paper proposes that, within a future contingent, five types of externalities (network effects, complementary products, horizontalization, complementary assets, interconnect coupling) contribute to value creation in distributed contexts. Externalities leverage expectations of value creation through non-linear mechanisms which lie outside direct organizational control. To overcome this open-control dilemma, control must be reconceptualized for distributed contexts. Excludability of others granted by ownership rights; influencing through tactics not necessarily co-extensive with ownership; and monitoring of dynamics are the three immanent modalities of an integrative view of control. Based on these five types of externalities and three modalities of control propositions are made to successfully play the ecosystem game."
Fattoum Asma,Delmar,01/11/2011,anglais,The impact of separated voting and cash-flow rights on French IPO valuation,"This paper examines how the use of mechanisms separating voting rights from cash flow rights – such as dual share classes, pyramid structures and voting pacts agreements– influence the valuation of firms at IPO. We claim that these mechanisms, adopted by founder-CEOs to insulate them against the market for corporate control and to maintain private benefit extraction, have negative effects on IPO valuation. However, we also claim the negative impact of these disconnecting mechanisms on IPO valuation to be moderated by (1) firm size and age and (2) founder-CEO’s status and equity retained at the IPO. We examine our claims using a unique hand-collected dataset of all 258 IPO’s involving founder-CEOs completed in the French capital markets from 1995 to 2010. We find support for our first claim. We found only mixed support for our second claim with retained equity moderating the effect."
Marmenout Katty,,01/11/2011,anglais,Peer interaction in mergers,"Following abundant anecdotal evidence of low morale in mergers and its important detrimental effect on postmerger performance, the purpose of this multimethod experimental study was to find out how employee reactions to a merger evolve over time following peer interaction (i.e., discussion with colleagues). Using a scenario study, initial reactions to a merger announcement were compared with socially influenced reactions. As anticipated, an overall strong detrimental effect of peer interaction on employee reactions was observed. Next, findings indicate that deal characteristics (culture clash potential, announced degree of integration, and position in deal structure) play a moderating role. Indeed, how peer interaction affects outcomes depends on the position in the deal structure. Qualitative data analysis of the group discussions sheds light on how employee reactions become more detrimental. This process is conceptualized as 'collective rumination,' defined as repetitively and passively discussing organizational problems and their negative consequences with a group of peers. The study concludes with implications for practice and identifies three powerful levers (active involvement, distraction, and positive leadership) to influence the way in which employees react to the event."
Melkonian Tessa,Monin NOORDERHAVEN,01/11/2011,anglais,"Distributive justice, procedural justice, exemplarity, and employee’s willingness to cooperate in M&A integration processes","Although employees' willingness to cooperate is acknowledged as a critical success factor for post-M&A (merger-and-acquisition) integration, we still know little about the psychological mechanisms that lie beneath employees' cooperative attitudes and behaviors in this context. Building on the premises of fairness heuristic theory, this longitudinal study explores how the relative importance of distributive and procedural justice judgments for employees' willingness to cooperate shifts over time. We suggest that when employees lack justice-relevant information on both distributive and procedural aspects of decisions, they will use another temporary heuristic to reduce uncertainty by scrutinizing the M&A-related cooperative behaviors of authority figures. We test our hypotheses on data from a four-time repeated cross-sectional survey of employee responses in a post-M&A integration process. The findings provide important insights into how merging firms can enhance employees' willingness to cooperate through the subtle exercise of justice and exemplarity."
Phan Michel,Thomas Heine,01/11/2011,anglais,Social Media and Luxury Brand Management,"Social networks, and social media as the tools, are everywhere in the marketer’s world today. Their growing importance was quickly acknowledged and they were casted one of the top research priorities by the trustees of the Marketing Science Institute (MSI) in 2006. Brands, and in particular luxury brands with their high brand equity, ought to have a clear understanding of what social media could do for them, and develop a clear strategy of how they could enhance customers’ experience and perceptions of their brands.<br /><br /> Social media are highly related with the concept of Web 2.0, which go back to O’Reilly (2005) who realized that the companies that had survived the dot-com bubble in 2001 seemed to have something in common. These shared principles and practices are the modern second era of the web that can be described as Web 2.0. Beyond the social classification of content by tagging (folksonomy), Web 2.0 pages allow and encourage the creation of user-generated content. This includes creating and sharing texts, pictures or videos and commenting and editing on existing content. Besides these practices, the Web 2.0 principles require webpage creators to trust and to involve their users, but enable them to harness network effects and collective intelligence to create applications that actually get better the more people use them. The collection of these interactive, user-controlled applications can be described as social media.<br /><br /> Besides blogs and forums, content communities facilitate storage and sharing of media content between users. They empower users to upload a wide range of different media types, such as photos (e.g., Flickr), videos (e.g., YouTube), PowerPoint presentations (e.g., Slideshare), podcasts (e.g., PodOmatic) and text (e.g., BookCrossing). Social network sites (e.g. LinkedIn) enable users to connect and stay in touch with other people. Brands can exploit the potential of social media by establishing an online brand community, which is a specialized, non-geographically bound community, based on a structured set of social relations among admirers of a brand. A brand community is created by setting up a profile on a social network site or by developing an own brand community website. The most important social media pages that are used by many luxury brands include Facebook, Twitter, and You Tube. These platforms encourage communication between brands and consumers, but also among the consumers themselves as they can view and comment each other’s messages.<br /><br /> This study examines how Burberry succeeded an amazing turnaround from a brand for “chavs” and English hooligans to a major trendsetter in social media marketing. Burberry was the first luxury fashion brand to invest wholeheartedly in social media. Burberry’s Facebook page now has more than 7 millions fans and its Twitter’s account recorded more than 400,000 followers, way ahead of Louis Vuitton, Gucci and other fashion brands. Burberry was also the first to broadcast live and in 3D its fashion show from London to five international cities simultaneously in 2010. In April 2011, Burberry staged a catwalk show in Beijing where live models are mixed with holograms, creating a new and unique experience for its audience. All the videos were immediately posted on YouTube for fans that had missed the shows. This social media strategy helped Burberry to rejuvenate the brand and reposition it as a more fashionable and aspirational one than ever. With this repositioning Burberry can attract younger consumers. However, to preserve its core customer base the company continues to invest in mainstream marketing activities such as print media advertising and public relations. The company recorded a whopping 34% increase in total revenue in the second quarter of 2011 alone, confirming its strong financial health of 39.8% increase in profits (before tax) of the previous financial year, ending at 31st March 2011. The company’s steep rise in recent years gives reason enough to dedicate this paper to analyzing its major strategies and success factors. One of Burberry’s key success factors was undeniably its decision to be the first luxury brand to invest in digital communications, and social media in particular, to reposition its brand as a ‘cool and trendy’, and increase its appeal to younger and web-savvier consumers. Young consumers are the future of all fashion brands and Burberry knows “how” to speak to them directly through social media. Social media platforms such as Facebook or Twitter are the best means to reach young consumers that are increasingly difficult to address via TV advertising. Burberry is the best-ranked luxury brand in the Top Social Network ranking by Famecount in 2011. In the overall brand category, it spotted the 22nd position behind brands such as Coca-Cola, Starbucks and H&M, but the best among luxury brands, ahead of BMW and Chanel (Famecount, 2011). Moreover, Burberry was ranked the most popular FTSE100 Company on Facebook and Twitter, according to a report by social media agency Three-D in 2011 (Retail Week, 2011). Social media seem to play a key role in Burberry’s success. However, how did it actually manage to exploit their potential? Is the high number of fans on social media a good indicator of success? Companies are beginning to understand that the brand transition to social media ultimately involves a re-casting of the customer relationship. In social media, the customer is an ally, not an “audience.” The audience model is a carryover from obsolescent marketing thinking, as if the brand was an “act” in front of a crowd. A brand that considers customers an “audience” often finds itself resorting to theatrics to make an impression. These can work, for a time, but at the cost of a stagnating brand on a shrinking stage. As allies, customers can add value to the brand, many times over. It will be interesting to see how Burberry handles the “customer audience vs. customer ally” question in the future.<br /><br /> The objective of the paper is to highlight how Burberry managed to re-build its luxury image over the last ten years while being closer to its customers than ever and accessible to the mass through its social media marketing. The paper successively presents the heritage of this iconic English fashion brand, its strategy to overcome a major drop in its brand desirability in the late 1990’s with the arrival of Rose Marie Bravo as the Chief Executive Officer. It will then analyze the revitalization strategy of the brand with the arrival of its Creative Director Christopher Bailey in 2001. Burberry’s social media strategy, initiated by the current CEO Angela Ahrendts, and its performance will also be evaluated using the findings of two recent independent studies. Burberry’s social media performance can definitely be improved and it will be with time, as social media will help it to run the business differently. Finally a discussion about the importance of social media for luxury brand management is presented. The conclusion highlights the fast-growing importance of the Chinese market where Burberry is deploying the most advanced brand experience to its consumers. The lessons learned from this study will certainly help luxury brand marketers to engage in social media if they were still hesitant, or improve their social media strategy if they have started, but not sure of how and where to go next."
Billette de Villemeur Etienne,Ruble Versaevel,01/10/2011,anglais,Coordination and Cooperation in Investment Timing with Externalities,"We characterize sequential (preemption) and simultaneous (coordination) equilibria, as well as joint-value maximizing (cooperation) solutions, in a model of investment timing allowing for externalities in both ‡ow pro…ts and investment costs. For two ex-ante symmetric …rms, either preemption or attrition occur depending on the size of the investment externality. Coordination is less likely with more discounting, as in a repeated game, and more likely with higher growth and volatility. Optimal cooperation involves either monopoly or duopoly investment, the latter being either symmetric or asymmetric. Finally, these characterizations are validated by applications to standard speci…cations of capacity accumulation and of R&D investment. In the former setup, coordination is likelier if installed capacities and lumpy investments are both large. With R&D input choices, if investment synergies are large, coordination and cooperation result in the same outcomes."

Wright Mike,JACKSON FROBISHER,01/10/2011,anglais,Private equity in the U.K.,"Despite the recent downturn, private equity firms still have an important role to play in the global economy. At the same time, many PE firms may need to rethink their strategies. Practices that have been worked in the past may not produce acceptable returns in a future, particularly given the current constraints on financing and leverage. One source of PE's comparative advantage, as demonstrated during the recent crisis, has been the ability of the best and most experienced firms to reorganize their portfolio companies when they get into financial trouble. But in addition to their financial management skills, specialized operating expertise has become more critical to success, and those PE firms that have not acquired it are especially likely to find that past success in raising capital is no guarantee of success in the future. The authors begin by providing a brief overview of the past three decades of global private equity to identify how the market arrived at its current position. Using the findings of academic research together with case studies and interviews with PE practitioners in the U.K., the authors suggest a number of building blocks for the future that reflect the considerable success of the most reputable and experienced PE firms in increasing the value of their portfolio companies."
COULON Jérôme,Malevergne,01/09/2011,anglais,Heterogeneous expectations and long range correlation of the volatility of asset returns,"Inspired by the recent literature on aggregation theory, we aim at relating the long range correlation of the stocks return volatility to the heterogeneity of the investors’ expectations about the level of the future volatility. Based on a semi-parametric model of investors’ anticipations, we make the connection between the distributional properties of the heterogeneity parameters and the autocovariance/ auto-correlation functions of the realized volatility. We report different behaviors, or change of convention, whose observation depends on the market phase under consideration. In particular, we report and justify the fact that the volatility exhibits significantly longer memory during the phases of speculative bubble than during the phase of recovery following the collapse of a speculative bubble."
Delmar Frédéric,Wennberg HELLERSTEDT,01/09/2011,anglais,Endogenous growth through knowledge spillovers in entrepreneurship,"Endogenous growth theory suggests that technological knowledge stimulates growth, yet the micro-foundations of this process remain obscure. Knowledge spillover theory posits that growth is contingent on the technology dependence of industries, forming the landscape for entrepreneurs to launch and grow ventures. We investigate these theoretical contingencies with two research questions using comprehensive employee-employer data documenting the science and technology labor force in Sweden. First, do industries with a greater need for new technology-based entrepreneurship grow disproportionately faster than other industries? Second, are the knowledge spillover effects fostering the growth of new technology-based firms contingent on certain industry structures?"

We build upon the evolutionary perspective considering where resources come from to help define these competencies and explain their paths of development. The study follows the creation and early growth of four university spin-offs within the UK and Norway. We identified three competencies of opportunity refinement, leveraging, and championing that appeared crucial for the ventures to gain credibility. Although selected competencies were inherent within the academic founders, the specific competencies for venture creation had to be developed or acquired. This was achieved iteratively through entrepreneurial experience and accessing competencies from disparate actors such as industry partners and equity investors. Propositions are offered to guide future empirical research based upon our framework."

Sinaceur Marwan,VAN NEAL ADAM Haag,01/09/2011,anglais,Hot or cold,"Is communicating anger or threats more effective in eliciting concessions in negotiation? Recent research has emphasized the effectiveness of anger communication, an emotional strategy. In this article, we argue that anger communication conveys an implied threat, and we document that issuing threats is a more effective negotiation strategy than communicating anger. In 3 computer-mediated negotiation experiments, participants received either angry or threatening messages from a simulated counterpart. Experiment 1 showed that perceptions of threat mediated the effect of anger (vs. a control) on concessions. Experiment 2 showed that (a) threat communication elicited greater concessions than anger communication and (b) poise (being confident and in control of one's own feelings and decisions) ascribed to the counterpart mediated the positive effect of threat compared to anger on concessions. Experiment 3 replicated this positive effect of threat over anger when recipients had an attractive alternative to a negotiated agreement. These findings qualify previous research on anger communication in negotiation. Implications for the understanding of emotion and negotiation are discussed."

Balogun Julia,Jarzabkowski Vaara,01/08/2011,anglais,"Selling, resistance and reconciliation","Studies of political dynamics between multinational enterprise (MNE) parents and subsidiaries during subsidiary role evolution have focused largely on control and resistance. This paper adopts a critical discursive approach to enable an exploration of subtle dynamics in the way that both headquarters and subsidiaries subjectively reconstruct their independent-interdependent relationships with each other during change. We draw from a real-time qualitative study of a revealing case of charter change in an important European subsidiary of an MNE attempting to build closer integration across European country operations. Our results illustrate the role of three discourses – selling, resistance and reconciliation – in the reconstruction of the subsidiary–parent relationship. From this analysis we develop a process framework that elucidates the important role of these three discourses in the reconstruction of subsidiary roles, showing how resistance is not simply subversive but an important part of integration. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the micro-level political dynamics in subsidiary role evolution, and of how voice is exercised in MNEs. This study also provides a rare example of discourse-based analysis in an MNE context, advancing our knowledge of how discursive methods can help to advance international business research more generally."

Calcagno Riccardo,KRAUSSL Monticone,01/08/2011,anglais,An analysis of the effects of the severance payment reform on credit to Italian SMEs,"We study the effects of the reform of the system of severance payments (TFR) of Italian employees on the cost and the access to credit for small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs). The most direct consequence of the reform is to reduce in the long run the amount of liquid assets available to Italian firms. We argue that this reform, implemented in July 2007, will reduce the aggregate investment by SMEs in a more than proportional way, since it will restrict the access to credit for some of them (Holmstrom and Tirole, 1997). However, we also predict that the reform will not increase the cost of intermediated finance, coeteris paribus. In order to assess the effects of the reform on the investment of SMEs and on the cost of bank loans, we also estimate the future outflows of TFR funds due to the reform."
Cova Bernard,Salle,01/08/2011,anglais,Shaping projects,"To improve its chances of success, a project supplier will look at shaping the projects very early in the project cycle. These shaping approaches are well known for being particularly difficult to apply within the framework of public markets where the purchasing procedure is highly regulated. However, for Public Private Partnerships (PPP) a specific approach is covered by the regulations for a very precise case, that of unsolicited proposals. Through the case study of a company which presented an unsolicited proposal to the Italian Minister of the Interior aimed at reducing the financial outlay of the Italian State in the fight against fires, this paper aims at conceptualizing new macro-shaping practices that enable the nature of the project to be co-defined. The case makes it possible to bring the understanding of project marketing and the marketing of solutions up to date by investigating in detail the combination of the dual upstream-downstream movement of project suppliers and of the enlargement of the offering."
Groh Alexander,GOTTSCHALG,01/08/2011,anglais,The effect of leverage on the cost of capital of US buyouts,"This paper addresses the problem to assess the effect of leverage on the cost of capital for buyout performance analyses. It draws on a unique and proprietary set of data on 133 US buyouts between 1984 and 2004. For each of them, we determine a public market equivalent that matches it with respect to its timing and its systematic risk. We show that under realistic mimicking conditions, the average cost of capital is below the commonly used benchmark S&P 500. Thereby, we control for two important aspects: for the risks taken by lenders in the buyout transactions (which affects the sponsors’ risks), and for the corresponding cost of debt (which lowers the return of the public market equivalent). Only with borrowing and lending at the risk-free rate is the average cost of capital close to the average index return. This finding is particularly important as existing literature on that topic tends to rely on benchmarks without a proper risk-adjustment."
Lipuma Joseph,Prange Park,01/08/2011,anglais,Venture capitalists' and entrepreneurs' knowledge in new venture internationalization,"Explanations of internationalization focus on knowledge and experience accumulation over time. Research on international new ventures (INVs) suggests that young companies may follow an accelerated expansion strategy, mainly based on the knowledge of the entrepreneur or that of associated outsiders. Research on the role of venture capitalists' knowledge in the internationalization process has been sparse, despite their acknowledged role as providers of knowledge and networks in addition to financial capital. By deconstructing knowledge types relevant to internationalization, we explore their source in the entrepreneur-venture capitalist dyad. We utilize the literature on ambidexterity as a lens through which we examine potential substitution effects, and suggest a number of propositions as a basis for future empirical research."
Pardo Catherine,Portier Salle,01/08/2011,anglais,Integrating Marketing and Purchasing within the same company,"nteractions between the marketing function and other different functions (e.g. marketing and sales; marketing and operations, marketing and Research & Development...) have widely been discussed by the literature. Interfunctional collaboration is, furthermore,largely considered as impacting positively on business performance.Nevertheless, one of these interactions –the one between the purchasing function and the marketing function -has been investigated mostly on an inter-organizational basis (in the sense of how and why the marketing function of a selling firm must interact with the purchasing function of the buying one). The intra-organizational aspect of such an interaction –how in the same companycan the purchasing and the marketing functions interact?–has largely been neglected by the literature. This work in progress paperaddresses this specific aspect of the marketing / purchasing interaction. Itis based on a case study carried out in a chemical company. It describes how a marketing team emerged and developed within a corporate purchasing departmentto bring information about upstream markets to the business units. Drawing on the findings of this case study we discuss several aspects of the integration of marketing and purchasing within the same company, among them: 1/ The impact of a difference of organizational status between marketing and purchasing; 2/ The unusual role played by purchasing as a “cross-road” function; 3/ The importance of top management involvement in supporting interfunctional integration; 4/ The importance of a real strategic vision of what integration may bring to a company"
Aktas Nihat,DE COUSIN,01/07/2011,anglais,Do financial markets care about SRI?,Mergers and acquisitions offer a framework for shedding new light on the stock market performance of socially responsible investments (SRI). We use Innovest’s Intangible Value Assessment (IVA) ratings as a measure of firms’ ability to cope with social and environmental risks. The IVA ratings allow us to uncover a positive relation between acquirer gains and the level of the target’s social and environmental risk management practices. Our findings suggest that the stock market rewards the acquirer for making socially and environmentally responsible investments. We also document that the environmental and social performance of the acquirer increases following the acquisition of a SRI aware target. These results are consistent with acquirer learning from the target’s SRI practices and experiences.

BROWN Dana,NEW,01/07/2011,anglais,The four challenges of supply chain transparency,"In this article we examine a key business question: how much should organizations know about their extended supply base, and what should they do with this information? This question has become of urgent practical significance for firms across industry sectors, as they square up to the complex inter-connectedness of the modern world. We present a series of challenges that firms can use to frame an initial review of their own practices."
Courpasson David,Marti Dany,01/07/2011,anglais,Entrepreneur in spite of himself,"In this paper we offer a story of intra-organizational occupational entrepreneuring. The paper develops an approach enabling to understand how a process of entrepreneuring can develop within an organization, which we define as a highly constraining context. We highlight how an individual called Jacques in the paper, is capable to oppose hierarchical decisions affecting his working context, and subsequently generates the conditions for an entrepreneuring process to exist, without seeing himself as an entrepreneur. The paper connects studies of resistance and studies of entrepreneurship to suggest that entrepreneuring processes can create subjective moments of ‘micro-emancipation’ in a business organization. We also offer an interactionist interpretation of the story of Jacques, so as to demonstrate the power of an ‘inhabited’ version of entrepreneuring ventures within organizations, with individuals finding in the concrete activities and events they perform and live the resources they need to define their projects and strengthen their convictions."

Dany Françoise,LOUVEL VALETTE,01/07/2011,anglais,Academic careers,"Despite serious criticism, the boundaryless view of careers still heavily influences research. This article aims to do more than just challenge the claim that careers are becoming more boundaryless: our goal is to make clear that careers need to be thought of in alternative terms. To this end, we build on an analysis of academic careers to explain why regarding careers as either bounded or boundaryless is too simple and why more attention should be paid to the scripts that influence career choices. We draw from an empirical study carried out in two French universities that shows that promotion scripts operate under three conditions – credibility, legibility, and legitimacy of promotion models. We conclude that scripts are potentially very useful in understanding a wide range of careers."
Fayolle Alain,,01/07/2011,anglais,Necessity Entrepreneurship and Job Insecurity,"Who would dream of associating the figure of the entrepreneur with poverty and precariousness? Traditionally, society and literature paint a very different picture of the entrepreneur, who embodies such values as risk and initiative-taking, a strong sense of responsibility, action- and result-orientation, and even opportunism, etc. The author argues in this paper that present (and past) measures intended, in the French context, to encourage the creation of new jobs and new ventures by job seekers and/or individuals in precarious situations contributes greatly to the development of some forms of ‘forced’ entrepreneurship, which may have dramatic consequences for the individuals concerned and society at large. The objective of this paper is to shed some light on these particular forms of entrepreneurship, which are likely to increase in the current context of uncertainty and change."
Groh Alexander,LIECHTENSTEIN,01/07/2011,anglais,International Allocation Determinants of Institutional Investments in Venture Capital and Private Equity Limited Partnerships,"We examine the determinants of institutional investors when deciding about international capital allocation in venture capital and private equity limited partnerships through a questionnaire addressed to limited partners world-wide. The respondents provide information about their criteria for international asset allocation. The protection of property rights is the dominant concern, followed by the need to find local quality general partners, and the quality of management and skills of local entrepreneurs. Furthermore, the expected deal flow plays an important role in the allocation process, while investors fear bribery and corruption. Public funding and subsidies are not important for the international allocation process. Hence, private money does not follow public money. Additionally, IPO activity and the size of local public equity markets are not as relevant as proposed by other researchers. Our results can support policymakers to increase the attractiveness of their countries for institutional investors to receive more risk capital for innovation, entrepreneurship, employment and growth."
Lawton Thomas,Rajwani O'Kane,01/07/2011,anglais,Strategic reorientation and business turnaround,"This paper aims to illustrate how legacy airlines can reorientate to achieve sharp recoveries in performance following prolonged periods of stagnation, decline and eroding competitiveness. The authors use a qualitative analysis of five longitudinal case studies of legacy airlines that embarked on strategic change between 1997 and 2006. Data collection spanned ten years and included archival data, public documents, news clippings, accounts in specialist books and internal company documentation. The paper identifies two distinct approaches for reorientation in the legacy airline industry. Companies that have fallen behind and are in risk of failure focus on regaining customer trust and loyalty, and restructuring route networks, business processes and costs in an improvement and innovation"" reorienting approach. Underperforming airlines, for whom growth has declined in traditional markets and who note that opportunities exist elsewhere, focus on product and service development and geographical growth in an ""extension and expansion"" reorienting approach. The paper develops a framework for successful reorientation in the legacy airline industry. This framework encourages executives to focus on and leverage profit maximization, quality, leadership, alliance networks, regional consolidation and staff development during periods of strategy formulation and reorientation. This research addresses the dearth of understanding and attention afforded to the concept of reorientation in the literature on strategic turnaround. The research also serves to emphasize the presence and importance of reorientation as a strategy of change within the legacy airline industry. Furthermore, in demonstrating how this strategy can be implemented in a sharp-bending or performance improvement context, this study illustrates how reorientation is intertwined with the broader turnaround process."""
Monties Vanessa,,01/07/2011,anglais,Entrepreneurship as a heritage from Pandora's box,"This paper is an attempt to participate in the on-going discussion about the multiple facets of entrepreneurship and to add some new light and comments away from the traditional pantheon. The aim is to provide an alternative reading which may help to reveal some subtleties and complexities"" thanks to the use of myths as metaphors to illustrate the entrepreneurial condition. Following recent critical literature, I try to question and deconstruct the positive taken-for-granted images of entrepreneurship and the entrepreneur as an emancipated hero. Thus the success of a few has been mythicized while the difficult reality of the majority of entrepreneurs has been ostracized. What kind of myths then could illustrate metaphorically the entrepreneurial experience? On the one hand, I try to emphasize the positive extra-ordinary dimension of this so-called 'modern hero', embodied by Hercules, the almighty achiever archetype, and Spartacus, the social and institutional entrepreneur. On the other hand, I propose a vision of the entrepreneurial character as both prisoner of his/her entrepreneurial condition and used as an ideological tool to reinforce the position of the dominant group. The mythological characters of Sisyphus, the constrained entrepreneur, and Tantalus, the tormented victim of gods’ will, illustrate these perspectives."""
Bouchard Véronique,Fayolle,01/06/2011,anglais,Implementing Corporate Entrepreneurship,"Encouraging employees to adopt entrepreneurial attitudes and behaviors increasingly appears to a number of economic players as the antidote to company staleness and inertia, and lack of creativity and innovation. Yet, in practice, how can firms foster these types of attitudes and behaviors ? Our study of corporate entrepreneurial practices in 22 firms provided insights into the most frequent organizational levers used by companies as well as how these levers are combined. Firms can adopt a number of approaches to foster entrepreneurship, depending on their objectives, characteristics and context. Firms thus deploy unique sets of means and resources, which are interdependent and act as a system shaping employee attitudes and behaviors. It therefore appears necessary to study both the independent means and resources used and the way they are combined into formal systems designed to effectively foster entrepreneurial behavior. After a review of the main organizational levers used by firms to effectively support and foster entrepreneurial attitudes, our article presents a typology of formal corporate entrepreneurship systems, followed by a detailed presentation and discussion of the various system types thus identified. We feel that this exploratory and descriptive study is a key step towards understanding the variety of approaches available to firms and how they can effectively implement corporate entrepreneurship."
Dattée Brice,Autio,01/06/2011,anglais,Externalities and control mechanisms in business ecosystems,"In distributed contexts, firms face a dilemma between value creation through leveraging externalities and value appropriation through maintaining “control”. This paper proposes that, within a future contingent, five types of externalities (network effects, complementary products, horizontalization, complementary assets, interconnect coupling) contribute to value creation in distributed contexts. Externalities leverage expectations of value creation through non-linear mechanisms which lie outside direct organizational control. To overcome this open-control dilemma, control must be reconceptualized for distributed contexts. Excludability of others granted by ownership rights; influencing through tactics not necessarily co-extensive with ownership; and monitoring of dynamics are the three immanent modalities of an integrative view of control. Based on these five types of externalities and three modalities of control propositions are made to successfully play the ecosystem game."

It is these questions, among others, that the book explores and discusses in particular. The future steps in required developing European entrepreneurship in a dynamic and international context are also analyzed and synthesized. The expert contributors reveal both the macro and micro factors that influence European entrepreneurial development, with an emphasis on high-tech firms.

Groh Alexander,LIECHTENSTEIN,01/06/2011,anglais,The first step of the capital flow from institutions to entrepreneurs,"We contribute to the knowledge of the capital flow from institutional investors via venture capital (VC) funds as intermediaries to their final destination, entrepreneurial ventures. To this end, we conduct a world-wide survey among limited partners to determine the importance of several criteria when they select VC funds. We find the top criteria to be the expected deal flow and access to transactions, a VC fund’s historic track record, his local market experience, the match of the experience of team members with the proposed investment strategy, the team’s reputation, and the mechanisms proposed to align interest between the investors and the VC funds. A principal component analysis reveals three latent drivers in the selection process: ‘Local Expertise and Incentive Structure’, ‘Investment Strategy and Expected Implementation’, and ‘Prestige/Standing vs. Cost’. It becomes evident that limited partners search for teams which are able to implement a certain strategy at a given cost. Thereby, they focus on an incentive structure that limits agency costs."
Guedri Zied,McGUIRE,01/06/2011,anglais,"Multimarket competition, mobility barriers, and firm performance","This study develops and tests a theoretical framework which suggests interactive dynamics, with strong performance implications, between the height of mobility barriers surrounding strategic groups and the extent of within-group multimarket competition. Empirical analysis drawn from a longitudinal sample of pharmaceutical firms indicates that within-group multimarket competition has strong positive effect on firm performance for strategic groups surrounded by high mobility barriers. As we move lower on the mobility barriers hierarchy, this effect decreases, becoming non-significant for groups surrounded by moderate mobility barriers and negative for groups surrounded by low mobility barriers. These findings highlight the conditions under which mobility barriers and multimarket competition have significant performance implications. In addition, our results suggest that mobility barriers and multimarket competition are not substitutive but complementary devices promoting mutual coordination within strategic groups. Finally, our findings point to the need to consider multimarket contacts as an aggregate property of strategic groups."
Quittard-Pinon François,Randrianarivony,01/06/2011,anglais,Impacts of Jumps and Stochastic Interest Rates on the Fair Costs of Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit Contracts,"The authors offer a new perspective to the field of guaranteed minimum death benefit contracts, especially for simple return premium and rising floor guarantees. A particular feature of these contracts is a guaranteed capital upon the insured’s death. A complete methodology based on the generalized Fourier transform is proposed to investigate the impacts of jumps and stochastic interest rates. This paper thus extends Milevsky and Posner (2001). If jumps alone are considered, similar results are obtained, but, when stochastic interest rates are introduced, the fair costs of the guarantee feature are found to be substantially higher in this more general economy."

The discussion begins with a review of varying conceptions of Enterprise 2.0 to identify the potential impact, value levers, and challenges of these applications in sales and marketing. This conceptual framework is then applied to explore how a major technology supplier is executing 2.0 strategies in their own organization. The case study describes the business challenges the company that has justified the focus on Enterprise 2.0, the individual skills that facilitated their initial progress in this area, and the roadmap and metrics used to guide and evaluate these experiments. A short discussion section will close the case by exploring the value proposition for the organization and the industry as a whole."
Vaara Eero,RIAD,01/06/2011,anglais,Varieties of national metonymy in media accounts of international mergers and acquisitions,"International mergers and acquisitions (M&As) often invoke national identification and national cultural differences. We argue that metonymy is a central linguistic resource through which national cultural identities and differences are reproduced in media accounts of international M&As. In this paper, we focus on two revealing cases: the acquisition of American IBM Personal Computer Division (PCD) by the Chinese company Lenovo and the acquisition of American Anheuser-Busch (A-B) by the Belgian–Brazilian company InBev. First, we identify the forms, functions, and frequencies of national metonymy in media accounts of these cases. We present a typology that classifies varieties of national metonymy in international M&As. Second, we demonstrate how these metonyms combine with metaphor to generate evocative imagery, engaging wit, and subversive irony. Our findings show that national metonymy contributes to the construction of emotive frames, stereotypes, ideological differences, and threats. Combinations of national metonymy with metaphor also provide powerful means to construct cultural differences. However, combinations of metonymy with wit and irony enable the play on meanings that overturns and resists national and cultural stereotypes. This is the first study to unpack the deployment of metonymy in accounts of international M&As. In doing so, it also opens up new avenues for research into international management and the analysis of tropes in management and organization."

Design/methodology/approach – This conceptual paper builds on a historical review of the two main currents of the corporate entrepreneurship literature and the distinction established by French scholars between “traditional SMEs” and “miniature large firms”. Findings – The paper summarizes various findings regarding the antecedents of EO and intrapreneurship in SMEs and elaborates a series of testable propositions linking EO to intrapreneurship. Practical implications – The paper posits the existence of different types of SMEs and suggests that the organizational and managerial antecedents of EO differ by type. Originality/value – The paper explores the relation between intrapreneurship and EO, thus connecting two unrelated streams of literature within the field of corporate entrepreneurship."

Melkonian Tessa,Picq,01/05/2011,anglais,Building Project Capabilities in PBOs,"Project-based organizations (PBOs) have become a widespread form of organizations, ideally suited to deal with unstable and dynamic environments. However, PBOs inherently incorporate the conflicting needs of, on the one hand, the temporary nature of projects and on the other hand, the more permanent organizational setting that defends long-term development and intra-organizational coordination. To overcome this differentiation/integration dilemma, the recent literature suggests that PBOs must develop Project Capabilities, defined as the internal ability of a PBO to create lasting performance based on multiple short term projects. But we still know little about how such Project Capabilities may be efficiently developed in PBOs. In order to contribute to the capabilities perspective on PBOs, this paper proposes to approach Project Capabilities building processes as a multi-level and dynamic process, and offers as an illustration the case of a very specific PBO—the French Special Forces (SF). The Special Forces context provides a particularly interesting illustration of how to build Project Capabilities over time, to the extent that they have been carrying out successfully multiple projects in extreme contexts for more than 60 years."

SUDARSANAM Sudi,Wright HUANG,01/05/2011,anglais,Target bankruptcy risk and its impact on going private buyout performance and exit,"Research Question/Issue: What is the impact of bankruptcy risk on whether listed corporations are likely to be bought out by private equity firms and on the subsequent exit, including bankruptcy, of private equity backed public to private buyouts? Research Findings/Insights: Using a sample of 246 UK companies that went from public to private (P2P) company status from 1997 to 2005, we find that companies going private have a significantly higher default probability. Private equity firms sponsoring P2P deals acquire firms with a higher risk of bankruptcy than non-acquired firms that remain public. We find evidence that high receivership risk at going private increases the chance that the target will end up in receivership, but post-P2P bankruptcy likelihood is less when the P2P is a management buyout rather than any other form of buyout. Independent boards of pre-P2P targets promote P2P deals and reduce the chances of bankruptcy after the buyout, suggesting a good corporate governance structure makes a positive contribution to bankruptcy avoidance after going private transactions. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our finding that P2P deals involve targets with a higher risk of bankruptcy adds to theoretical insights about private equity. In contrast to previous research, it suggests that PE firms are not deterred by the risk of financial distress but consider it a value creating opportunity. Our use of the option pricing framework represents a first and novel attempt at measuring bankruptcy risk and its impact on the ability of private equity firms to achieve effective turnaround. We find a link between better governance of the target pre-P2P and lower bankruptcy risk since where the PE investor inherits a strong governance structure, manifested in independent boards, chances of subsequent bankruptcy are reduced. Similarly, where the P2P acquisition is a management buyout, the probability of bankruptcy, post-P2P, is reduced, suggesting lower informational asymmetries and better alignment of interests between managerial and private equity investors. Although, due to the small number of receivership exits in our sample of P2P firms, the results are not as strong as we would like, a more extended analysis involving a larger sample over a longer period, in particular of firms exiting through bankruptcy is expected to produce stronger results. Our results provide a sufficient basis to warrant such further analysis. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Private equity backed P2Ps of listed corporations with high bankruptcy risk augment the market for corporate control as they provide an alternative purchaser to traditional acquirers. Our finding that high bankruptcy risk at going private increases the chance the target will end up in receivership suggests a need for caution on the part of private equity firms since the turnaround of P2P targets appears to depend on how seriously distressed they are at the P2P stage. Private equity firms therefore need to engage in careful due diligence. Private equity firms need to give attention to the nature of the pre-P2P governance regime when selecting P2P targets, in particular the extent to which better monitoring by independent directors has been in place and where there is greater alignment of interests between managers and LBO sponsors since these contribute to bankruptcy avoidance. For listed corporations, our findings suggest that strengthening of independent boards may contribute to timely decisions to sell troubled corporations."
Calcagno Riccardo,Monticone,01/04/2011,anglais,Financial literacy and the demand for financial advice,"The low level of financial literacy in many countries suggests that households are at risk of sub-optimal financial decisions. In this paper we assess to what extent financial advisors can substitute for the households' lack of financial knowledge, by analyzing the effect of investors' financial literacy on their decision about how much to rely on financial advisors. We model the strategic interaction between poorly informed investors and better informed advisors facing conflict of interests. We find that advisors reveal information only to the more knowledgeable investors, who anticipating that are more likely to consult advisors. Investors with lower financial literacy either invest by themselves (without any professional advice) or delegate their portfolio choice completely, su ffering the agency costs of such decision. These results are con firmed empirically, where we investigate the effect of financial literacy on the demand for financial advice using the 2007 Unicredit Customers' Survey. Overall, our results suggest that non-independent advisors are not sufficient to alleviate the problem of low financial literacy."

Fayolle Alain,Degeorge,01/04/2011,anglais,The entrepreneurial process trigger,"Purpose – In France, there seems to be no immediate correlation between the desire to opt for an entrepreneurial career and actually starting or taking over a business. Based on this observation, the purpose of this paper is to focus on the entrepreneurial process and more specifically on its trigger phase; the exploratory research question is: how to model the entrepreneurial process trigger phase? Design/methodology/approach – First, based on a review of the literature, the authors seek to identify the main concepts that can be used to study the entrepreneurial process trigger. Second, the authors try to show the articulation between these various concepts with a view to proposing a typology of the entrepreneurial process trigger. In order to model the trigger phase, the authors rely mostly on the concepts of intention and displacement and works by Shapero and Sokol, by Ajzen, and by Krueger and Carsrud. The authors study the case of French engineers by drawing on previous research, notably the database of French engineers assembled by Fayolle. Concerning the methodological approach, first a quantitative analysis was performed on the sample, which was completed with a qualitative study. Findings – Thanks to the questionnaire, the authors were able to identify eight possible career paths based on the initial measurements made by Fayolle in 1996; then various trigger paths were tested. Finally, a model of the trigger phase is proposed based on the qualitative study. Two determining dimensions emerge through analysis of the results: the trigger paths evolve differently over time. Furthermore, the intensity and impact of displacements are perceived differently by individuals. This leads the authors to propose a mapping of the four identified trigger processes. Originality/value – At the theoretical level, this research contributes to mapping out the various trigger processes of new venture creation. By incorporating the time dimension, it was possible to outline the sequence of events. The authors shed some light on the entrepreneurial process by showing the main factors that can lead an individual to go from intention to action. In light of the results, the authors feel it necessary to reject any determinist interpretation of the French engineers’ career paths. The interactions between personal and contextual variables add to the complexity of the phenomenon, as contextual and environmental factors play a significant role in the trigger of the entrepreneurial process. The present work provides insights into the decisive factors in the career orientation of French engineers, and it can be replicated with samples from various nationalities."
Groh Alexander,LIECHTENSTEIN,01/04/2011,anglais,Determinants for allocations to Central Eastern Europe venture capital and private equity limited partnerships,"Growth expectations and institutional settings in Central Eastern Europe (CEE) seem favorable for establishing a vibrant venture capital and private equity (VC/PE) market. However, the risk capital supply there is rather small in relation to the growth prospects. We examine the determinants of institutional investors’ CEE allocation decisions through a questionnaire addressed to limited partners worldwide. Investors in CEE VC/PE limited partnerships are very knowledgeable about the region, they also appreciate other emerging regions, they regard entrepreneurial opportunities in CEE as very favorable, and they attribute local general partners in CEE with a high level of professional quality. In more detail, they appreciate team independence and the match of fund strategies with the teams’ backgrounds. As economic growth expectations are fairly high in all emerging regions, investors focus on other allocation determinants, notably on the potential of institutional and cultural characteristics to turn the economic growth into entrepreneurial activism."
Langevin Pascal,Mendoza,01/04/2011,anglais,Budgeting systems and organizational commitment,"Research in management accounting has recently introduced Organizational justice theory to better explain how budgeting systems that are perceived to be fair can improve managers' attitudes and behaviours, in particular trust in supervisor and organizational commitment. Based on survey responses from 137 managers, this study shows that three budgetary characteristics, namely budgetary participation, application of the controllability principle and quality of feedback, increase the overall perception of justice. Findings also show that perceived justice and trust in supervisor mediate the effect of budgetary characteristics on organizational commitment."
RENARD Nicolas,Sitz,01/04/2011,anglais,Maximising sponsorship opportunities,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to identify the key elements that maximise sponsorship opportunities and that enable a successful relationship between a sponsor and a sponsored party. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is based on a review of the literature and takes a case study approach. The paper first identifies the classic aspects of sponsor relationships and then explores new criteria to propose a brand model approach. Practical examples are taken out of the sailing team Alinghi who raced the America’s Cup. Findings – The paper suggests that the key success factor for a sponsored party is to act as a brand. This brand should have four strong pillars to build its brand essence: its own identity, a clear offer for a value creation process, an organisation to support this offer in line with strategic alliances of the sponsor and identified targets or consumers. Originality/value – Sponsorship is part of the daily life of any business and can take many forms. Moreover, the large number of sponsorship opportunities does not help entities looking for financial support to stand out easily. However, few opportunities meet all criteria to build an effective sponsor relationship. The authors believe that a brand model approach is the best way to achieve such goal. Alinghi (America’s Cup 2003 and 2007 winner) is a perfect example of this new approach."
Silberzahn Philippe,Van Dyck,01/04/2011,anglais,The Balancing Act of Innovation,"Innovations are everywhere – and they matter. They matter because they change our lives, for better or worse, and because they are the source of long-term growth. But is innovation always the best policy? Is ‘now’ necessarily the best time to innovate? And how exactly should we go about it? This book seeks to provide the answers to some of these questions. It is not a detailed manual for innovation, since experience suggests that there is no such thing as a simple set of successful innovation recipes, which work at all times and in all places. For this reason, the book – written for practising managers and students of company-level innovation – uses a case-based methodology from which readers can learn practical lessons. At the same time it provides examples of creative approaches followed by less publicly well-known, high-impact SME innovators, or by leading well-established firms applying less known, high-impact innovation strategies. It shows how innovators as diverse as Bongo, GreenPan, Studio 100, Cronos, Belgacom Mobile, Arteconomy, QOD, Sigasi, VIB, Janssen Pharmaceutica, and Alcatel-Lucent – companies which range from big to small, high-tech to low-tech, new to old, product-based to service-based, well known to less well known – have succeeded in completing their innovation journey. The cases discuss topics as varied as creativity, growth, product leadership, business model change, as well as finance and commercialisation. There are many possible roads to innovation. Successful innovation means defining your own road. The purpose of this book is to help you plan your journey along your own particular route."
Tornikoski Christelle,,01/04/2011,anglais,Fostering expatriate affective commitment,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine whether organizations can encourage the loyalty of their international employees through the composition of their expatriate packages. Design/methodology/approach – Two separate but complementary theoretical perspectives – the total reward approach, and the exchange-based construct of state of the psychological contract (SPC) – are used to explain the affective commitment of expatriates. Hypotheses are developed and tested on a sample of 263 assigned and self-initiated expatriates from Finland. Findings – A positive SPC relating to tangible universal rewards (i.e. the compensation package traditionally considered in previous expatriate research) is not linked to an increase in the overall affective commitment of expatriates. In contrast, a very strong positive relationship was found between the expatriates’ SPC relating to total rewards (which include intangible particularistic rewards (IPR)) and affective commitment. Research limitations/implications – The sample only includes highly educated Finnish expatriates, which limits the external validity of the results. Moreover, the cross-sectional nature of this study does not allow for confirmation of the cause-effect relationship between the SPC and affective commitment. Practical implications – The results suggest that, as a rule, organizations could improve the retention of their valuable international employees via the exchange of IPR usually found in socio-emotional and trusting employment relationships. Originality/value – First, this paper focuses on expatriate perceptions regarding their compensation. Second, it applies the “concreteness” and “particularism” dimensions developed by Foa and Foa to distinguish between the constituting components of the bundle of total rewards and provide an evaluation-oriented measure of the SPC relating to this bundle. Third, this approach enables explaining expatriates’ affective commitment."
TORRES Olivier,,01/04/2011,anglais,The silent and shameful suffering of bosses,"Of all the decisions that managers of SME have to make, laying off someone is the most difficult as well as the hardest to live with. Layoffs are often seen as a personal failure with mental and psychological consequences that can be disastrous for both the person laid off and the employer responsible. Curiously, the suffering experienced by the employer is never mentioned in the SME context. The works in human resources management that deals with layoffs tend to focus on the employees laid off and on employees who escape layoff. There are also studies of the 'blues' felt by human resources managers (HRM) when they have to implement a downsizing policy. But few studies on SME (not to say none at all) take any interest in the psychological impact this decision has from the point of view of the employer, the SME owner."
Giraud Laurent,Fichet,01/03/2011,anglais,Information flow in project-based companies,"How is information flow processed in project-based companies compared to others and how it affects strategic drift? Existing theories concerning strategy, communication and organisation has been confronted in order to create an original lens through which we look at companies. Based on this lens are qualitative interviews led to collect empirical data from two hierarchical levels in four companies with very different businesses. After analysis, the study shows that the strategic drift is well known by companies. Good communication is recognised as a way to tackle this strategic drift and is high on companies' agenda. The project-structure owns several assets (like customization, size and resilience) which make it better to process information flow and which eventually reduce or eliminate the strategic drift. Yet, classical organisations and project-structures seem to create synergy for a company which uses adequately both, regarding the type of business."
Marion Gilles,Nairn,01/03/2011,anglais,"We make the shoes, you make the story"": Teenage girls' experiences of fashion""","This article explores the ways that French teenage girls use fashion discourse to construct their evolving identity from their recently left childhood to their future as fully grown women. Verbatim texts of 14 phenomenological discussions concerning clothing, accessories, make-up and fashion are interpreted using the concepts of bricolage (Lvi-Strauss), tactics (Certeau) and narrative identity (Ricur). The findings resonate with Thompson and Haytko's portrayal of a dialogical relationship between consumers and a system of countervailing fashion meanings and with Murray's exposition of a dialectical and discursive tension between sign-experimentation and sign-domination. But beyond this we elucidate the process by which teenagers also acquire, from personal social milieu, skills and tactics through which they toy with preconstrained sartorial symbolism to construct the plot line of their own lives which, in turn, reflects their past, defines their present self and presages their future."
Mutabazi Evalde,Poirson,01/03/2011,anglais,RTDF MOTORS : How to facilitate an industrial cooperation process between French and Chinese companies?,"The issue is focused on two French and Chinese teams involved in an industrial cooperation process between two big truck makers: Renault Trucks and Dong Feng Motors. Born after the merger of Saviem and Berliet ( two French companies), Renault Trucks became more and more international all along these ten last years. Before the Volvo – Renault Trucks merger its values and management models had been deeply influenced by the values of the two founder companies. Dong Feng motors is one of the three leading companies in the Chinese automotive industry. With a 124 000 persons workforce, this industrial group manufactures 120 000 trucks and 300 000 cars a year, i.e. 11 % of the Chinese car market and 39 % of the trucks over 6 tons market. Dong feng motors owns three industrial sites in central China. The Shiya plant which is involved in the cooperation process with Renault trucks is located at 1500 kms South West of Beijing."

Schildt Henri A.,Mantere Vaara,01/03/2011,anglais,Reasonability and the linguistic division of labor in institutional work,"We examine institutional work from a discursive perspective and argue that reasonability, the existence of acceptable justifying reasons for beliefs and practices, is a key part of legitimation. Drawing on philosophy of language, we maintain that institutional work takes place in the context of ‘space of reasons’ determined by widely held assumptions about what is reasonable and what is not. We argue that reasonability provides the main contextual constraint of institutional work, its major outcome, and a key trigger for actors to engage in it. We draw on Hilary Putnam’s concept ‘division of linguistic labor’ to highlight the specialized distribution of knowledge and authority in defining valid ways of reasoning. In this view, individuals use institutionalized vocabularies to reason about their choices and understand their context with limited understanding of how and why these structures have become what they are. We highlight the need to understand how professions and other actors establish and maintain the criteria of reasoning in various areas of expertise through discursive institutional work."
Vaara Eero,Faÿ,01/03/2011,anglais,How can a bourdieusian perspective aid analysis of MBA education ?,"There is a lack of integrative conceptual models that would help to better understand the underlying reasons for the alleged problems of MBA education. To address this challenge, we draw on the work of Pierre Bourdieu to examine MBA education as an activity with its own “economy of exchange” and “rules of the game.” We argue that application of Bourdieu’s theoretical ideas elucidates three key issues in debate around MBA education: the outcomes of MBA programs, the inculcation of potentially problematic values and practices through the programs, and the potential of self-regulation, such as accreditation and ranking for impeding development of MBA education. First, Bourdieu’s notions of capital—intellectual, social, and symbolic—shed light on the “economy of exchange” in MBA education. Critics of MBA programs have pointed out that the value of MBA degrees lies not only in “learning.” Bourdieu’s framework allows further analysis of this issue by distinguishing between intellectual (learning), social (social networks), and symbolic capital (credentials and prestige). Second, the concept of “habitus” suggests how values and practices are inculcated through MBA education. This process is often one students acquire voluntarily, and students often regard problematic or ethically questionable ideas as natural. Third, Bourdieu’s reflections on the “doxa” and its reproduction and legitimation illuminate the role of accreditation and ranking in MBA education. This perspective helps to understand how self-regulation may impede change in MBA education."
Vaara Eero,TIENARI,01/03/2011,anglais,On the narrative construction of multinational corporations,"Although extant research has highlighted the role of discourse in the cultural construction of organizations, there is a need to elucidate the use of narratives as central discursive resources in unfolding organizational change. Hence, the objective of this article is to develop a new kind of antenarrative approach for the cultural analysis of organizational change. We use merging multinational corporations (MNCs) as a case in point. Our empirical analysis focuses on a revelatory case: the financial services group Nordea, which was built by combining Swedish, Finnish, Danish, and Norwegian corporations. We distinguish three types of antenarrative that provided alternatives for making sense of the merger: globalist, nationalist, and regionalist (Nordic) antenarratives. We focus on how these antenarratives were mobilized in intentional organizational storytelling to legitimate or resist change: globalist storytelling as a means to legitimate the merger and to create MNC identity, nationalist storytelling to relegitimate national identities and interests, Nordic storytelling to create regional identity, and the critical use of the globalist storytelling to challenge the Nordic identity. We conclude that organizational storytelling is characterized by polyphonic, stylistic, chronotopic, and architectonic dialogisms and by a dynamic between centering and decentering forces. This paper contributes to discourse-cultural studies of organizations by explaining how narrative constructions of identities and interests are used to legitimate or resist change. Furthermore, this analysis elucidates the dialogical dynamics of organizational storytelling and thereby opens up new avenues for the cultural analysis of organizations."
Aktas Nihat,DE Roll,01/02/2011,anglais,Serial acquirer bidding,Recent academic studies indicate that acquirers' cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) decline from deal to deal in acquisition programs. Does this pattern suggest hubristic CEO behaviors are significant enough to influence average CAR patterns during acquisition programs? An alternative explanation is CEO learning. This study therefore tests for learning using successive acquisitions of large U.S. public targets undertaken by U.S. acquirers. A dynamic framework reveals that both rational and hubristic CEOs take on average investor reactions to their previous deals into account and adjust their bidding behavior accordingly. These results are consistent with a learning hypothesis.

Specifically, we focus on the identification of the needed competencies by the entrepreneur throughout the process of venture creation. For this, we subscribe to the thesis of Bruyat and Julien (2001), and to the processual approach of Fayolle (2007b), according to which the venture creation process is declined into three stages: release, entrepreneur’s commitment and survival – development of the new project. We propose a cognitive approach allowing the enumeration of specific competencies required in each step of the entrepreneurial process."
Neri Cassio,Schneider,01/02/2011,anglais,A family of maximum entropy densities matching call option prices,"We investigate the position of the Buchen-Kelly density [10] in the family of entropy maximising densities from [21] which all match European call option prices for a given maturity observed in the market. Using the Legendre transform which links the entropy function and the cumulant generating function, we show that it is both the unique continuous density in this family and the one with the greatest entropy. We present a fast root-finding algorithm that can be used to calculate the Buchen-Kelly density, and give upper boundaries for three different discrepancies that can be used as convergence criteria. Given the call prices, arbitrage-free digital prices at the same strikes can only move within upper and lower boundaries given by left and right call spreads. As the number of call prices increases, these bounds become tighter, and we give two examples where the densities converge to the Buchen-Kelly density in the sense of relative entropy when we use centered call spreads as proxies for digital prices. As pointed out by Breeden and Litzenberger [6], in the limit a continuous set of call prices completely determines the density."

The products were developed as a result of market needs identified as a result of a water contamination crisis in Sydney in 1998. From a venture capital point of view it shows that the biotech sector provides opportunities without major investments. It also reveals that a trade sale is a good exit alternative because a strategic price can be achieved and most of the cash is paid up front and not vulnerable to the vicissitudes of the public markets. The case also illustrates that a sale of a company by a VC is a difficult process that needs comprehensive management time as there are many stakeholders involved.

Drawing from the knowledge-based view, we investigate which firms benefit most from agglomeration and discuss how the implications for entrepreneurs are significant if some firms benefit more from geographic agglomeration than others. We investigate three particular firm attributes that may accentuate or mitigate benefits tied to participation in a cluster. We test our hypotheses on a sample of biotechnology firms and find strong evidence that firms benefit asymmetrically. Younger firms and firms with higher knowledge stocks benefit more from agglomeration."

Prange Christiane,VERDIER,01/01/2011,anglais,"Dynamic capabilities, internationalization processes and performance","Strategies of internationalization have long been the focus of international business and global strategy research. While the major theories – process theory and new venture theory – have substantially contributed to our understanding of internationalization processes, they have not yet fully explained differences in firms’ growth and survival rates. Adopting a dynamic capability perspective, we argue that there are two opposing classes of explorative and exploitative capabilities differentially linked to output variables. We introduce the notion of third-order capabilities to balance trade-offs and maximize internationalization performance. Amodel with some testable propositions is developed which prepares the ground for future empirical research."

Central to this theory is the notion that the emergence of new firms’ network structure is not only influenced by past histories of focal agents but also by complex, semi-reversible interactions between ties. Using an inductive qualitative approach we induce a tie-order theory drawing on interviews with six new companies in the UK’s independent television production sector over three years. We find that establishing key ties in sequence enhances resource collation, and amplifies perceptions of influence, impacting in turn on network outcomes."

Crespin-Mazet Florence,Portier,01/12/2010,anglais,The reluctance of construction purchasers towards project partnering,"While the literature argues that there are several benefits for construction purchasers who join forces to co-develop the project with contractors and to increase cooperation between the various project stakeholders (construction partnering), little research has been done on the reasons for the lack of extensive diffusion of such methods in the construction industry. This paper aims at understanding the rationale behind the reluctance of construction purchasers for this coordination mechanism in France. In particular the paper investigates the impact of the characteristics of the project but also of the characteristics of the purchasing companies in their project procurement behaviour. The findings reveal that the characteristics of the purchasing companies in terms of purchasing strategy, structure and culture seem more explanatory of their procurement behaviour than of the project characteristics. The paper suggests that the lack of diffusion and understanding of construction partnering may be due to the resistance of purchasers who feel threatened by the structural changes it involves in their purchasing habits."
JOHNSON Alan R.,Delmar,01/12/2010,anglais,The Psychology of Entrepreneurs,"In this chapter, we suggest links between previous and future research into the psychology, more specifically the motivation of entrepreneurs using a self-regulation perspective. Recent research in work motivation has shifted its focus from the single concept of goal setting and intentions towards a broader understanding of self-regulation processes (Diefendorff & Lord, 2008). Self-regulation, as we see it, is the capacity of individuals to guide their activities over time and across changing circumstances (Kanfer, 1990). We aim to incorporate this broader understanding into entrepreneurship research, as we believe it allows for a better understanding of the function and form of the entrepreneurial mindset. In addition, a self-regulation perspective permits integration of empirical findings about the dynamic nature of the entrepreneurial process, while keeping goal directed individuals as the central protagonists in that process."
Lipuma Joseph,HOEHN-WEISS,01/12/2010,anglais,Substitutes or complements?,"Principal Topic: Inter-firm ties with different partners, such as alliance partners and corporate venture capital (CVC) investors display complex characteristics; at times these relationships act as complements and at other times substitutes (Dushnitsky & Lavie, 2009). Extant literature only considers the impact of these relationships on the investor and not on the venture receiving the capital. This omission is serious because, new ventures, more so than mature companies, have to consider the reinforcing or attenuating nature of these relationships when weighing decisions regarding tie formation with different types of partners. Drawing on the resource-based view, we investigate this reinforcing versus attenuating effect of alliances and CVC on new-venture internationalization because internationalization is important for venture growth and because both types of relationships have been shown to affect internationalization (see, for example, Lu & Beamish, 2006; Al-Laham & Souitaris, 2008; Leiblein & Reuer, Fernhaber & McDougall-Covin, 2009). Method: The sampling frame comprises approximately 800 U.S.-based, high-technology, VC-backed new ventures founded during the 1990s and executed an IPO from 1995-2002. We compiled the data and verified certain key variables using the following sources: VentureXpert and Global New Issues within Thomson Financial’s SDC Platinum database, Lexis-Nexis, COMPUSTAT, and SEC S-1 and 10-K filings. We use a 2-stage Heckman selection model, with the first stage (selection model) addressing probability of internationalizing and the second stage (effects model) addressing intensity of internationalization (FSTS). Results and Implications: Approximately 10% of companies had foreign sales in their IPO year. Internationalization requires capital and time investments. Alliance management requires attention to ensure congruency between partners’ and entrepreneurs’ objectives; limiting relationships to those providing value relative to strategic foreign market entry goals is imperative. Entrepreneurs may not need to obtain CVC if alliances substitute value. If alliances complement CVC, entrepreneurs should develop structures and capabilities necessary to optimally manage their use. The examination of the substitutability or complementarity of resources sheds light on the interaction effects of resources necessary for competitive advantage. The current study seeks to extend this analysis of such resource relationships to the realm of new ventures and their ability to intensify their international activities."
Liu Xiaohui,Wright Filatotchev DAI Lu,01/12/2010,anglais,Human mobility and international knowledge spillovers,"Using novel survey data, we examine the relationship between returnee entrepreneurs, multinational enterprise (MNE) work experience of domestic entrepreneurs, and firms' innovation performance in high-tech SMEs in China. We adopt an integrated framework that combines the knowledge-based view and social capital theory to investigate whether human mobility across national borders and MNE work experience facilitate international knowledge spillovers. We find that firms founded by returnees are more innovative than their local counterparts. We also find that returnee firms have an indirect impact/spillover effect on non-returnee firms' innovation performance and act as a new channel for technological knowledge spillovers. The findings show that the presence of a technology gap positively moderates the effect of returnee spillovers on non-returnee firms' innovation performance, but the impact of MNE work experience on local innovation is constrained by the technology gap. Our results extend the existing literatures on knowledge spillovers and strategic entrepreneurship and have important managerial and policy implications."

Using various proxies, we find that latent competition increases the bid premium offered in negotiated deals and that auction costs reduce the premium."

In this paper we try to fill the gap by developing an innovative multi-layer accuracy metric that we test on a novel database. Our analysis shows that forecasting accuracy is very limited: prediction errors are consistent, auto-correlated, non-mean reverting and large (up to 36.6%). The size of forecasting errors increases with the predicted growth in the stock price, the size of the company and for loss making firms. Additionally, the intensity of research and the market momentum negatively affect accuracy. These results suggest that analysts' research is systematically biased which supports theoretical predictions by Ottaviani and Sorensen (2006). Since stock price forecasting is largely an unmonitored activity, market participants may fail in fully understanding this behavior, thus not arbitraging away these inefficiencies."

Guedri Zied,Eminet,01/11/2010,anglais,The role of nominating committees and director reputation in shaping the labor market for directors,"Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Do the presence and independence of nominating committees within boards of directors affect the extent of rewards and sanctions provided by the labor market to directors with a reputation for being active in monitoring management?corg_814 557..574 Research Findings/Insights: Results drawn from a longitudinal sample of directors sitting on the board of 200 public French firms suggest that the stronger a director’s reputation for being active in increasing control over management, the larger the number of his or her subsequent appointments to (1) boards with a nominating committee; (2) to boards with a nominating committee that excludes the CEO; and (3) to boards with a nominating committee dominated by non-executive directors. In contrast, we found that a director’s reputation of being active in increasing control over management does not impact the number of his or her subsequent appointments (1) to boards without a nominating committee; (2) to boards with a nominating committee that includes the CEO; and (3) to boards with a nominating committee dominated by executive directors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study shows that the outcome of the power struggle between the CEO and incumbent directors during the candidate selection process determines the profile of directors who will ultimately obtain the board appointment. On the one hand, independent nominating committees are likely to reduce the influence of CEOs over the process of a director’s appointment, and therefore are likely to increase the recruitment of directors with reputations for being active in exercising control over managers. On the other hand, nonexistence of nominating committees or presence of weak nominating committees under the influence of the CEO decouple directors’ reputations for being active in controlling management from the likelihood of obtaining new appointments. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights to policy makers interested in increasing the efficiency of the labor market for directors. More specifically, it highlights the conditions under which directors with a reputation of being active in increasing control over management are likely to be rewarded by the labor market for directors. These conditions include (1) the creation of a nominating committee; (2) exclusion of the CEO from this committee; and (3) domination of this committee by outside directors."

We draw from Critical Discourse Analysis to better understand the power of strategic plans as a directive genre. In our empirical analysis, we examined the creation of the official strategic plan of the City of Lahti in Finland. As a result of our inductive analysis, we identified five central discursive features of this plan: self-authorization, special terminology, discursive innovation, forced consensus and deonticity. We argue that these features can, with due caution, be generalized and conceived as distinctive features of the strategy genre. We maintain that these discursive features are not trivial characteristics; they have important implications for the textual agency of strategic plans, their performative effects, impact on power relations and ideological implications."

At the metalevel,it is important to focus attention on struggles over competing conceptions of strategy in this body of knowledge. At themesolevel it is interesting to examine alternative strategy narratives to better understand the polyphony and dialogicality in organizational strategizing. At the microlevel,it is useful to reflect on the rhetorical tactics and skills that are used in strategy conversations to promote or resist specific views. This paper calls for new focused analyses at these different levels of analysis, but also fo rstudies of the processes linking these levels."
Aktas Nihat,BELLETTRE COUSIN,01/10/2010,anglais,Capital Structure Decisions of French Very Small Businesses,"Very small businesses (VSB) experience financing constraints unlike those encountered by larger companies; however, they are rarely studied. Their unique characteristics, including the important information asymmetry they suffer and the predominant role of their shareholder–manager, may be well suited to a pecking order theory framework as a means to analyze their capital structure decisions. Specifically, VSB financing choices appear to follow a hierarchical order, such that they prefer internal to external financing and debt to stock issuance. Using a sample of 393,662 firm-year observations from 56,605 individual French VSB, this study shows that the pecking order theory can explain most of their financing decisions. In addition, a change in debt relates asymmetrically to financing deficit. Firms with a positive deficit rely almost entirely on debt for financing, whereas firms with a negative deficit (excess of financing) behave more conservatively and are less likely to repay their debts spontaneously in advance."

This intensive usage of trade credit is puzzling in the light of its high (implicit) costs, especially for financially unconstrained firms.

Then, using several proxies for firm’s investment quality (Z-score, return on assets, and long-run abnormal returns), we show that this prediction receives support from a large sample of U.S. firms"
Courpasson David,Thoenig,01/10/2010,anglais,When Managers Rebel,"This book is about rebellion, revolt and protest. One day, out of the blue, when not even they themselves are expecting it, somewhere one or more high-profile middle managers will rebel. These professionals refuse to maintain the pretence any longer and they are not afraid to say so out loud. What's more, they refuse to back down. These rebellions occur more often than you might think. Rebels remind companies that they cannot intrude on their middle managers' private lives with impunity and ignore the social, cultural and moral environment in which they operate. This is a managerial challenge that they ignore at their peril. Rebellion and protest need to be taken seriously. What little media attention had been given to the issue in the past has diluted it with ready-made explanations: Isn't this what companies are inevitably coming to at the start of the 21st century?; or ""Life is just tough for company employees, isn't it?"" This book will show just how hasty and superficial such conclusions are. Executive rebellion is a unique phenomenon, unlike any other. It is not always inevitable, and though it is often a result of a very negative situation, it can have positive results. In this intriguing book the authors demonstrate that when middle managers rebel they aren't just letting off steam, and that their acts of creative protest can even produce benefits for their companies. Rebellion sometimes pays off!"""
Cropanzano Russell,Stein Nadisic,01/10/2010,anglais,Social justice and the experience of emotion,"This book seeks to integrate the scholarship on justice and affect. The authors focus on empirical social scientific theories pertaining to fairness, mood and emotion. Most of the literature in this book is drawn from social and organizational psychology. Other areas included are management, personality and evolutionary psychology. The book includes coverage of relevant philosophical positions from Aristotle and Rawls. The goal of this book is to familiarize the reader with the rich tradition of conceptual models explaining the association between justice and emotion. It will be of interest to graduate students, researchers and practitioners in industrial organizational psychology, social psychology, management and business ethics."

Groh Alexander,WICH,01/10/2010,anglais,A Composite Measure to Determine a Host Country's Attractiveness for Foreign Direct Investment,"We contribute to the question of why some countries are more attractive for foreign direct investment (FDI) than others. Therefore, we construct a composite measure that describes a host country’s attractiveness for receiving FDI. This index considers all identified major, measurable and, for our scope, comparable aspects that affect FDI decisions. As a result, we can rank 127 countries with respect to their FDI attraction. The index provides the possibility of conducting detailed strength and weakness analyses for all of our sample countries and regions. These analyses provide support to policymakers to improve their country’s attraction for receiving inward FDI. They also enhance the discussion of why FDI flows still remain concentrated in advanced economies, and additionally, about the areas in which emerging and developing economies have to improve in order to narrow the existing gap. We provide correlation and sensitivity analyses to test the quality of our composite measure. Additionally, we benchmark our index with several alternative indices. Thereby, we show that no other index better tracks actual FDI activity"
Quittard-Pinon François,Randrianarivony,01/10/2010,anglais,Valuation of Equity-Linked Life Insurance Contracts with Fixed and Flexible Guarantees in a Non Gaussian Economy,"In this paper, we focus on the pricing of a particular life insurance contract where the conditional payoff to the policyholder is the maximum of two assets. We begin with the case of a Guaranteed Minimum Maturity Benefit contract where the guarantee is certain, and in a second part we consider a flexible guarantee leading to what we call a Pure Endowment Flexible Guarantee contract. In this latter case, both assets are risky. The first one has larger expected returns but is riskier while the second one is less risky but can still earn more than an investment in the risk-free asset. To take kurtosis into account the underlying dynamics have to be changed. In this paper, we suggest modelling the underlying dynamics of the second asset with a simple diffusion, i.e. a geometric Brownian otion with a low volatility, while the riskier asset follows a jump diffusion. More precisely, this process has a Brownian component and a compound Poisson one, where jump size is driven by a double exponential distribution. This stochastic process introduced by Kou (2002) is easy to use and proves to be a versatile tool. To price our life insurance contract, we use a generalized Fourier transform and obtain the solution numerically. As far as we know, this is the first paper to use this approach. This methodology proves to be very efficient both with respect to accuracy and to computational time. We incorporate mortality using a classical Makeham law."
Sarala Riikka M.,Vaara,01/10/2010,anglais,"Cultural differences, convergence, and crossvergence as explanations of knowledge transfer in international acquisitions","In spite of the proliferation of research on cultural differences in international mergers and acquisitions, we lack systematic analyses of the impact of cultural factors on knowledge transfer. In this paper, we argue that both national and organizational cultural differences and cultural integration in the form of cultural convergence and crossvergence affect knowledge transfer in acquisitions. We develop specific hypotheses concerning the nature of these effects, and test our hypotheses with data on international acquisitions carried out by Finnish corporations. The analyses performed show that national cultural differences provide great potential for knowledge transfer in international acquisitions. Furthermore, organizational cultural convergence and crossvergence have a significant positive impact on knowledge transfer. In particular, convergence and crossvergence moderate the impact of national cultural differences on knowledge transfer."
Azimont Frank,Araujo,01/09/2010,anglais,Re-classifying and Re-valuing Goods,This paper examines the notion of value and valuation as it has been developed within the IMP Market Studies tradition. Our key argument is that little attention has been paid to valuation processes and that valuation can be performed using a wide variety of scales. But rather to bring together all these scales under one rubric – e.g. the economist’s concept of utility – we propose that economic actors routinely engage in translations of value from one scale to another. We use the term derivation-conversion to show how these translations are performed using illustrations from a case study in the medical nutrition field. We conclude that derivation-conversion is a useful concept to understand how economic actors deal with the profusion of valuation alternatives in markets.
Azimont Frank,,01/09/2010,anglais,"Valuation, Metrologies and Judgements, a Study of Market Practices","This thesis investigates market practices and builds on the insight that markets are shaped and performed through multiple calculative agencies. It studies how the introduction of category management as part of a socio-technical agencement contributes to shaping goods, market place, configuration of buyers and sellers and their encounter in the fuel retail industry. After offering a critical analysis of four research strands (a practice based approach to markets, the Foucauldian study of governmentality, the sociology of translation and the sociology of socio-technical agencements) that take a performative view to the study of the economy and markets, I develop an approach that proposes to study markets rather than marketing through the analyses of bundles of practices. The identification of socio-technical agencements (STAs), the exploration of calculative practices and the study of how calculation is linked to agency, frame the way we understand how particular calculative practices make operable the assemblage of ideas, artefacts, practices, people, etc. that form and shape mundane markets. The thesis uses empirical data derived from a longitudinal ethnography of the petrol retailing arm of a multinational oil company. My analysis highlights the role of category management, a fuzzy theory, that helps glue market constituents together. It argues that valuation necessarily combines metrological practices and practical judgement resulting from experience, experimentation and equilibration. I identify two types of contexts involved in calculative practices, heuristic and algorithmic situations, and four type of practices involved in creating desirable and intelligible futures: realisation, potentialisation, virtualisation and actualisation practices."
Dontenwill Emmanuelle,Crespin-Mazet,01/09/2010,anglais,The impact of sustainable development on the firm's purchasing strategy,"This paper deals with the specific impact of sustainable development in purchasing and supply management. As a company “is no more sustainable than its supply chain” (Krause et al., 2009), the purchasing function plays a critical role in helping a firm reach its sustainable development objectives. However, green sourcing is not a straightforward task relying on marginal adaptations of existing purchasing practices and tools. The challenges introduced by sustainable development deeply affect purchasing and supply management strategies and practices and therefore foster a change in the firm’s supply network (Pagell et al., 2010).<br /><br /> After a literature review on sustainable supply chain development and supply network strategies, this paper will present the result of a longitudinal exploratory case study (over 3 years) of a French gardening products distributor– BOTANIC® – which has decided to place sustainable development at the heart of its corporate strategy since 2005. From 2005 to 2008, the researchers observed the transformations implemented by the purchasing function: evolution of specifications, changes in the supplier portfolio content and structure, changes of purchasing processes…<br /><br /> The analysis of the case study reveals the various factors impacted by the introduction of sustainability goals in the firm’s purchasing strategy and illustrates the specific challenges raised by the integration of new purchasing criteria (concerning the buyer’s competences, the issue of product labelling, partnerships with new stakeholders etc.). It confirms that the traditional focus on the minimization of costs and risks based on purchasing portfolio models might be suboptimal when sustainability becomes a competitive priority (Krause et al., 2009). It highlights the relevance of a network approach to supply management in the context of sustainable development (Gadde & Hakansson, 2001).<br /><br /> Following Krause et al.’s recommendations (2009), the paper then draws the consequences of these preliminary findings on purchasing and supply management and addresses the issue of how purchasing can become sustainable supply management. The relevance of relationshipbased sourcing strategies based on an extended sustainable supply network is then discussed."
Guedri Zied,Roux-dufort Park,01/09/2010,anglais,Success plants the seeds of future failure,"This study addresses two research questions. First, how do organizations behave after an enduring period of success? Second, what factors exacerbate or reduce the likelihood of occurrence of specific behaviors? Building upon self-serving attribution, over-confidence and superstitious learning reinforcement theories, we suggest that the greater the extent of success an organization achieves, the higher the level of conservatism and attachment to past strategies it will exhibit in the future. Such inertia decreases organization’s adaptation to the changes in the environment and may bring detrimental outcomes. We also suggest that the relationship between past success and future conservatism and attachment to past strategies is moderated by the concentration of power among decision-makers, the heterogeneity of decision-makers and the speed and non-ambiguity of subsequent performance feedbacks. We empirically investigate these hypotheses in the context of the motion pictures industry over the period 1995 through 2008."
Ivens Björn Sven,Pardo,01/09/2010,anglais,Ethical business-to-business exchange,"There is increasing interest in ethical questions in marketing. Most contributions to the marketing ethics literature refer to business-to-consumer situations and take an actor-focused perspective. Ethical issues arising on business markets characterized by inter-organizational exchange and network structures have received much less attention. This paper attempts to reduce this gap. It focuses on the specific question under what conditions exchange between companies can be qualified as ethical. For this purpose, the authors review articles providing sets of criteria for evaluating the ethicality of relational exchange. Using a case study they then challenge these criteria. They conclude that concepts such as trust, equity, responsibility, or commitment are not sufficient for judging the ethicality of exchange. Propositions are made as to how the current perspective on ethical business exchanges should be revised. The authors suggest going beyond the current thought world by considering externalities, stressing the norm of harmonization with the social matrix, and adopting a stakeholder-network perspective."
Laurent Bernard,,01/09/2010,anglais,Caritas in Veritate as a Social Encyclical,"While many elements of Benedict XVI's Caritas in veritate subscribe to the logic of earlier social encyclicals, the absence of a connection drawn between the social realities, the economic structures, and ideology sets this encyclical apart. Like its predecessors, however, it is marked with the seal of intransigence. In the face of modern culture (judged negatively by Benedict), the challenge is to restore Christian values to people's consciences. By framing the problem as he does, Benedict turns the Church's focus away from the interplay of structural forces and gives primacy, as never before, to individual responsibility."
LIM Elizabeth,LUBATKIN WISEMAN,01/09/2010,anglais,A Family Firm Variant of the Behavioral Agency Theory,"There is currently a debate in the literature regarding whether family firm ownership fosters or discourages risk-taking activities. In this article, we propose a contingency framework that shifts the focus of investigation: instead of asking whether family firms tend to be risk takers, we suggest specific ownership conditions under which privately owned family-managed firms are more likely to engage in risk taking. We do so by integrating concepts from the behavioral agency model and a resource-based concept known as familiness to advance a base proposition that explains the effects of different ownership structures (controlling ownership, sibling partnership, and cousin consortium) on risk-taking behaviors in family firms. Then, drawing insights from the family firm and household economics literatures, we discuss the contingent effects of three distinct forms of altruism (parental, paternalistic, and psychosocial) on the base proposition. The framework advances our current understanding of risk taking in family businesses in two ways: fi rst, by proposing how and when risk-taking behaviors differ across these firms; and second, by offering a variant of the base behavioral agency model that is better suited for explaining risk taking at family firms."

Marmenout Katty,,01/09/2010,anglais,Employee sensemaking in mergers,"This experimental study examines how employees make sense of a merger announcement and investigates the relationship between deal characteristics (culture clash potential, degree of integration, position in deal structure) and employee attitudes. A sensemaking mechanism is proposed and tested on graduate students subjected to merger scenarios. As employees make sense of the merger, higher perceived uncertainty is associated with greater dysfunctional outcomes. Although perceived uncertainty mediates the effect of perceived cultural similarity on employee attitudes, this is not so for perceived power. An employee’s position in the deal structure strongly influences perceived power, but unexpectedly, higher perceived power does not reduce uncertainty. Still, greater perceived power is directly associated with lower intention to leave and greater satisfaction. Although the degree of integration did not affect any of the outcome variables directly, complex interaction effects were found. Complementary qualitative data analysis sheds light on how employees make sense of the deal."
MISSIRILIAN Ohannes,Pardo Portier Salle,01/09/2010,anglais,Key supplier management,"Purpose of the paper: The paper deals with KSM (Key Supplier Management) which is the creation of a new mission (thus the creation of a new job, new practices, etc.) in a company so as to manage suppliers. KSM involves coordinating the company’s information and action in time and space in relation to an identified supplier in its entirety. The whole objective of KSM is to enable a company to generate an increased relational value (Henneberg et al., 2009; Pardo et al., 2006) compared with the one that could be forecasted with a “traditional management of suppliers”. Compared to what has happened with KAM on the marketing side of the company, KSM, on the purchasing side seems to encounter important difficulties relative to its implementation. The purpose of this paper is then to consider the existence of specific barriers the implementation of KSM..<br /><br /> Research method: In-depth interviews are conducted with 33 respondents within the purchasing functions of 10 multinational companies belonging to different industries using semi-structured interview following the structure used by Missirilian and Calvi (2004), which is based on the works from Homburg et al. (2002).<br /><br /> Research findings: The paper identifies three main obstacles that appear as more or less strong barriers to an easy implementation of key supply management. 1st barrier: the difficulty in implementing suppliers portfolios; 2d barrier: the narrow view of levers of value creation with suppliers; 3rd barrier: the everlasting lack of purchasing integration with other internal functions.<br /><br /> Main contribution: The paper proposes the idea of an asymmetry between purchasing and marketing situations. From a theoretical point of view the paper contributes to enriching scarce knowledge about KSM. Adopting a managerial point of view, the paper suggests a KSM position within the company that should be distinguished from the purchasing position and should appear as “an additional layer” in the organization."
Park Sarah,,01/09/2010,anglais,Acquisitions Disguised as Mergers of Equals,"Many M&A transactions are framed as mergers of equals when they are really acquisitions. This paper examines the tradeoffs and shareholder implications of this framing in the empirical context of U.S. M&A transactions between 1991 and 2005. By examining the tradeoff between target premium and post-merger control in pseudo mergers of equals, this paper offers new evidence for how merger outcomes are influenced by agency problems. The market reaction to pseudo mergers of equals announcement and post-merger performance are also analyzed. This paper suggests that in pseudo mergers of equals, gains to both target shareholders and acquirer shareholders are lower than gains in transactions accurately announced as acquisitions."
Prange Christiane,Bian,01/09/2010,anglais,MNC Mindsets Cognitive Construct Analysis of Chinese and European Managers,"Headquarter-subsidiary relations in multinational firms (MNCs) are important but difficult to manage. This is partly due to differences in managerial perceptions and their impact on decision-making. Perceptions can be interpreted as cognitive constructs or mindsets influenced by an individual’s existing knowledge base. While explicit knowledge components can be easily identified, this is more challenging for the tacit elements. We start with a qualitative approach and use the diary method, which we believe is more prone to eliciting managers’ MNC mindsets. Based on the analysis of twelve diaries, we identify perceived conflicts of subsidiary managers. We content-analyzed the data by using the software tool Leximancer and combine this with rigorous statistical analysis. Building on our analysis, we formulate hypotheses, future research avenues and managerial implications"
Azimont Frank,Araujo,01/08/2010,anglais,The making of a petrol station and the 'on-the-move consumer',"This paper addresses the issue of classification devices and their role in shaping markets. We depart from the notion that markets are shaped by multiple calculative agencies and examine how particular forms of calculation are made viable. Classification devices are the infrastructure that makes calculation possible and sustains particular economic orders. We illustrate these notions with an empirical, longitudinal study of a fuel retail company and its initiative to re-classify its network of petrol stations across Europe. Our study focuses on the extensive and protracted negotiations over what constituted relevant categories and the multiple perspectives involved in defining petrol station types. We illustrate how a store typology plays an important role in making assemblages of ideas (e.g. consumer-on-the-go), objects (e.g. store planograms), and managerial roles (e.g. category managers) coalesce around particular constellations of practices which impact upon the outline of markets."
Barbosa Saulo,Fayolle,01/08/2010,anglais,Revisiting Entrepreneurial Risk Taking,"The article examines ways in which new information about a new venture project influences the risk perceptions associated with the project and the decision to join it. The authors suggest that alterations in the framing of available data about a venture creation project change risk perceptions linked to the project, people's willingness to join the project and begin the venture. Availability and anchoring are cited as heuristics through which additional information about a new venture can bias risk perceptions and decision making. The authors also discuss how intuitive thinking may actually result in biased estimates that are subsequently used as a basis in decision making."

Moving away from a disembodied and asocial study of firm assets, technologies and practices, the strategy-as-practice approach breaks down many of the traditional paradigmatic boundaries in strategy to investigate who the strategists are, what strategists do, how they do it, and what the consequences or outcomes of their actions are. Including a number of detailed empirical studies, the handbook will be an essential guide for future research in this vibrant field."
Guedri Zied,Eminet,01/08/2010,anglais,The role of nominating committees and director reputation in shaping the market for directors,"Research Question/Issue: Do the presence and independence of nominating committees within boards of directors affect the extent of rewards and sanctions provided by the labor market to directors with a reputation for being active in monitoring management?corg_814 557..574 Research Findings/Insights: Results drawn from a longitudinal sample of directors sitting on the board of 200 public French firms suggest that the stronger a director’s reputation for being active in increasing control over management, the larger the number of his or her subsequent appointments to (1) boards with a nominating committee; (2) to boards with a nominating committee that excludes the CEO; and (3) to boards with a nominating committee dominated by non-executive directors. In contrast, we found that a director’s reputation of being active in increasing control over management does not impact the number of his or her subsequent appointments (1) to boards without a nominating committee; (2) to boards with a nominating committee that includes the CEO; and (3) to boards with a nominating committee dominated by executive directors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study shows that the outcome of the power struggle between the CEO and incumbent directors during the candidate selection process determines the profile of directors who will ultimately obtain the board appointment. On the one hand, independent nominating committees are likely to reduce the influence of CEOs over the process of a director’s appointment, and therefore are likely to increase the recruitment of directors with reputations for being active in exercising control over managers. On the other hand, nonexistence of nominating committees or presence of weak nominating committees under the influence of the CEO decouple directors’ reputations for being active in controlling management from the likelihood of obtaining new appointments. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights to policy makers interested in increasing the efficiency of the labor market for directors. More specifically, it highlights the conditions under which directors with a reputation of being active in increasing control over management are likely to be rewarded by the labor market for directors. These conditions include (1) the creation of a nominating committee; (2) exclusion of the CEO from this committee; and (3) domination of this committee by outside directors."

Schor treated consumer involvement empirically as a unidimensional construct, though she suggested that conceptually it may be multidimensional. Using confirmatory factor analysis procedures on data collected from children in the U.S. and U.K., the psychometric superiority of a threefactor structure is established, comprising dissatisfaction, consumer orientation, and brand awareness components. Additional analyses demonstrate distinct associations between each of these components and other constructs, including self-esteem, outside school activities, and child–parent relations. The scale’s generalizability across boys and girls is also confirmed. The results suggest that Schor’s Consumer Involvement Scale will be useful for researchers interested in studying the important topic of materialism in children."
ERKAMA Niina,Vaara,01/07/2010,anglais,Struggles over legitimacy in global organizational restructuring,"Critical organization scholars have focused increasing attention on industrial and organizational restructurings such as shutdown decisions. However, little is known about the rhetorical strategies used to legitimate or resist plant closures in organizational negotiations. In this article, we draw from New Rhetoric to analyze rhetorical struggles, strategies and dynamics in unfolding organizational negotiations.We focus on the shutdown of the bus body unit of the Sweden-based Volvo Bus Corporation in Finland. We distinguish five types of rhetorical legitimation strategies and dynamics. These include the three classical dynamics of logos (rational arguments), pathos (emotional moral arguments), and ethos (authority-based arguments), but also autopoiesis (autopoietic narratives), and cosmos (cosmological constructions). Our analysis contributes to previous studies on organizational restructuring by providing a more nuanced understanding of how contemporary industrial closures are legitimated and resisted in organizational negotiations. This study also increases theoretical understanding of the role of rhetoric in legitimation more generally."

Facing this diversity, our article aims to categorise firm's strategies engaged in entrepreneurial behaviours. After having recalled the characteristics of entrepreneurship considered from an individual perspective, we describe corporate entrepreneurship in its different forms, distinguishing its internal facets (revitalisation, sharing innovative approaches, developing new activities) and its external ones (corporate venture capital). Finally, in our last section, we propose a new framework that helps to recognise different types of entrepreneurial companies and encompasses the various initiatives that resort to corporate entrepreneurship."
Schlierer Hans-Jörg,Werner Garriga Fassin Signori Von Weltzien Hoivik Van Rossem,01/07/2010,anglais,How do European SME owner-directors make sense of 'stakeholder management'?,"The vast majority of empirical research on stakeholder management has traditionally focused on multinational corporations. Only in recent years, scholars have begun to pay attention to the stakeholder management concept within the context of small and medium-sized companies (SMEs). The few studies existing however discuss SMEs as a context free category or remain focused on single country analysis. This cross-national empirical research studies the small-business owner-managers’ perceptions of stakeholder management in six European countries. The comparative analysis is followed by a discussion about the linguistic and cultural elements that influence sensemaking of stakeholder management. The translation of the term “stakeholder” in the different languages and the context of its adoption and dissemination partially explain regional differences of perception. Our study questions the universality of management terms and warns that more attention should be paid to the institutional, cultural and linguistic environment that shape economic activity in different parts of Europe."

Find self-fulfillment through involvement in the project! But does a project not also destroy meaning, destabilize personnel and convey the germs of new pathologies? In companies, projects are machines for making requirements and judging people. No doubt, there is a gloomy side to projects, as shown by this analysis of verbatim accounts from participants in projects and a review of the scant managerial writings on this topic. For working conditions to worsen in direct proportion to an increase in the stimulation to outdo oneself through involvement in a company project, something must have gone awry in the realm of human resources — at the very heart of capitalism."

Marion Gilles,,01/06/2010,anglais,Conformity around dominant Marketing Cognitive Products,"The purpose of this article is to offer a set of propositions to explain why new paradigm announcements in the field of marketing ideas failed to trigger breaks with the dominant approaches. This field is considered a market where Marketing Cognitive Products (MCPs) are competing. Insofar as the quality of an MCP is neither perfectly observable nor fixed, we would argue that whether in the academic or practitioner segment of the cognitive market, its perceived quality is contingent upon processes of qualification. Three strong social processes increase the probability of conformity around dominant MCPs: the consequences of their market share; the network of interaction with mediators within a market segment; and the effects of MCPs’ story-telling power. In this stagnant situation, dominant MCPs gradually change and their domination is reinforced through the re-interpretation and co-optation of challengers. In the global cognitive market the dissemination of dominant MCPs is increasing the conformity of practitioners around these ideas, while the proliferation of MCPs is leading to customer confusion."

The 32nd America's Cup held in 2007 in Valencia, Spain, was a phenomenal success and represented a pinnacle in the evolution of this traditional yachting competition. Ernesto Bertarelli through Alinghi and America's Cup Management turned this historic sporting trophy into a profitable business with live TV coverage, amazing hospitality opportunities and a fantastic level of competitiveness amongst the participating race teams. He clearly led a revolution by building a new expertise and leadership, by working across cultures in a new way, by breaking rules and enhancing public attractiveness, by going behind boundaries and making the Cup a truly global event. He enabled the America's Cup to enter a new era. However, this bold approach was stopped by the opposition of the Golden Gate Yacht Club, represented in the race by the BMW-Oracle team, led by Larry Elisson. The America's Cup left the sea to be fought in court. Since July 2007, a justice drama has been making headline news forcing sailing teams to withdraw from the competition, sponsors to leave and jeopardizing the 33rd America's Cup.

Fassin Yves,Van Rossem Signori Von Weltzien Hoivik Schlierer Werner,01/05/2010,anglais,Sense-making of CSR and business ethics related concepts by small business leaders,"Principal Topic<br /> Business ethics and corporate responsibility have been given increased consideration from both academics (Epstein, 1987, Carroll, 2006) and practitioners in the last decades. The issue of corporate responsibility and ethics in small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) has only received limited attention in the literature (Spence, 1999). The perception of these notions in the entrepreneurial world can differ from the original academic definitions. In addition, given the impact of the entrepreneur as owner of his venture, corporate responsibility and ethical issues can take a different breadth within SMEs compared to large corporations. Different recent studies have compared the concepts of corporate responsibility, business ethics, sustainability, stakeholder management and related issues noticing many overlapping and similarities (Valor, 2005; Schwarz and Carroll, 2008).<br /><br /> Methods<br /> For this research, we aim at a cognitive approach. According to several authors (Daft & Weick, 1984; Weick, 1995) organizational sense-making proceeds from scanning of information sources, through interpretation of data to action. Mental representations or models then guide cognition and action relative to strategic choices (Stubbart, 1989) We use the Repertory Grid Technique (RGT), a methodology used to elicit and represent mental models. In a very sensitive area as business ethics and corporate responsibility, classic interviews and surveys present an important risk of bias of socially acceptable response. The repertory grid is a proven technique minimizing researcher bias compared to other cognitive mapping techniques (e.g., Easterby-Smith, Ginsberg, 1989) and gives way to both quantitative and qualitative analysis. A sample size of 15–25 interviewees within a population per researched culture/country generates sufficient constructs to approximate the universe of meaning surrounding a given situation, and is therefore sufficient for RGT (Ginsberg, 1989; Kaish & Gilad, 1991).<br /><br /> Key Propositions<br /> The aim of the study is to draw an intercultural and international comparison of how small business leaders perceive CSR and business ethics related concepts, how they differentiate between various concepts and determine which are the overarching concepts. Our key proposition is that cultural backgrounds will influence the perception and that concepts may have different meanings in the different European countries. It also states that differentiation between the concepts occurs in different way according the countries. A first study has been undertaken in Belgium. The study will now be replicated in France, Italy, and Norway, by local teams following the same format. A mix of cultures such of Latin, German, Scandinavian culture will allow to compare the perception and differentiation of the various concepts around ethics and corporate responsibility."
Gates Stephen,Langevin,01/05/2010,anglais,Strategic Human Capital Measures,"In his landmark book The ROI of Human Capital, Jac Fitz-enz presented a system of powerful metrics for quantifying the contributions of individual employees to a company’s bottom line.

Gomez Pierre-Yves,Korine,01/05/2010,anglais,The firm as a nexus of promises,"In this paper, we articulate the meaning of understanding the firm as nexus of promises, showing how the tendency towards null contracts in a world of increasing complexity makes promises central to governing the firm. Based on the specific case of the promise to increase return on equity in the publicly listed firm, we work out the structural determinants of the hierarchy of promises where the interests of employees and shareholders are contradictory, developing propositions about the relationship between the organization and composition of employees, on the one hand, and the organization and composition of shareholders on the other, and the propensity of firms to make promises. In the concluding discussion, we move beyond a structural explanation to explore how executives choose to ally with employees or shareholders, drawing on a discussion of the recent history of the financial services industry."
Langevin Pascal,Mendoza,01/05/2010,anglais,How can Organizational justice moderate the unethical behaviors induced by budgeting systems?,"Empirical research has shown that because budgets play key roles in organizations (goals setting, allocation of resources, performance evaluation and reward…), they may induce unethical behaviors, such as the creation of budgetary slacks and data manipulation. Recently, some studies have introduced Organizational Justice theory in the management accounting research and shown that these unethical behaviors could be reduced when budgeting systems were perceived as fair. However, few studies have systematically analyzed which characteristics of budgets could have this effect. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to this analysis and to formulate testable propositions regarding how some specific dimensions of budgeting systems can reduce slack creation and data manipulation through enhanced perceived fairness."

Wright Mike,BRUTON Filatotchev Chahine,01/05/2010,anglais,"Governance, ownership structure and performance of IPO firms","This paper examines performance effects of ownership concentration and two types of private equity investors (venture capitalists and business angels) in firms that have recently undergone an initial public offering (IPO) in the United Kingdom and France. We expand and contextualize nascent understanding of multiple agency theory by examining heterogeneity of private equity investors and by suggesting that multiple agency relationships are affected by different institutional contexts. We employ a unique, hand-collected dataset of 224 matched IPOs (112 in each country). Controlling for the endogeneity of private equity investors' retained share ownership, we find support for the agency theory argument that concentrated ownership improves IPOs' performance. The research also shows that the two types of private equity investors have a differential impact on performance, and the legal institutions in a given country moderate this impact."
JALKALA Anne,Cova Salle SALMINEN,01/04/2010,anglais,Changing project business orientations,"In this paper we draw together the changing orientations that have been shaping the project business arena during the past years and discuss their implications for the future of project marketing theory and practice. Based on empirical qualitative data from two longitudinal research programmes, we identify ten changing orientations shaping the international project business, and discuss how these orientations challenge the existing concepts of project marketing. By reporting several case examples from our cross-national qualitative data, we illustrate these orientations and analyse how they affect the behavior of project business companies. Finally we discuss them in the light of the existing project marketing concepts and propose new directions for project marketing research in order to keep up with these changing orientations. Based on each identified changing orientation we propose a possible shift in project marketing and draw implications for project marketing theory and practice."
Lalonde Carole,Roux-dufort,01/03/2010,anglais,Crisis management in institutional healthcare settings,"Sometimes inefficient management of crises may lead to remedies that prove to be as problematic as the ills for which a solution is sought. Usually, this discrepancy arises from a limited analysis of the crisis, the objective of which is to preserve institutional legitimacy, regardless the roots of the failure. But the roots of a crisis may be found in profound organizational mechanisms generally permitting organizations to function normally on a daily basis. A more substantive investigation of the roots of the difficulties sometimes endangers the very legitimacy that the organization seeks to preserve. The case of the St. Charles Borromée Centre analysed in this article provides an excellent illustration of this. In basing ourselves on this case, we will show that crisis management interventions sometimes result in making organizations yet more vulnerable through not dealing with the heart of the vulnerabilities and through perpetuating a deeper state of ignorance about them. To do this, we rely on a twofold interpretation of the concept of vulnerability, seen as a process of organizational fragilization on one hand and of underestimation of the risk, on the other hand. More precisely, the case presented in this article aims to show that authoritarian and punitive bureaucratic responses are not only stigmatizing but also insufficient to compensate for the institutional vulnerabilities of organizations such as long-term care facilities. Certain propositions advanced in the literature such as “good caring treatment” programmes, similar to the humanist values promulgated by OD, prove to be more promising and liberating in that respect."
Le Courtois Olivier,,01/03/2010,anglais,On Surrender Risk and the Default of Insurance Companies,"What is done in this article is: 1) the first paper where a model of surrender risk is constructed in order to anticipate the potential default risk of insurance companies. Indeed, bank runs have been studied a lot in the economics literature but not their insurance counterparts. The current global economic situation could make these events occur. Our paper aims at explaining that, and at giving the tools to avoid it. 2) the construction of a fully mathematically-equipped representation of dynamic insurance company balance sheets. 3) a model which relates mathematically a company's assets to the number of insured who have not yet surrendered, and which therefore relates surrender and default risks. 4) a numerical illustration that shows how surrender risk impacts default risk, and what can be done to limit the occurrence of these situations."
Sinaceur Marwan,THOMAS-HUNT NEALE O'NEILL Haag,01/03/2010,anglais,Accuracy and perceived expert status in group decisions,"We examined how the minority’s perceived (i.e., not real) expertise affects group discussion and performance. In two experiments, participants were randomly assigned to interacting groups in which the minority faction was perceived as either expert or not. Groups performed a decision task that involved solving a murder mystery. Both experiments showed that minorities perceived as expert (vs. not perceived as expert) made majority individuals acquire more accurate private judgments after group discussion, although the public group decision was not more accurate. In parallel, perceived expertise made minority members change their own judgments less. Experiment 1 also showed that minorities’ questioning behaviors mediated the effect of minorities’ perceived expertise on majority members’ private accuracy. Experiment 2 further showed that majority members’ deeper processing was also a mediator. Thus, minorities with perceived expertise serve as a catalyst, increasing the quality of majority members’ cognitions, but not their own."
Asquin Alain,Garel Picq,01/02/2010,anglais,When project-based management causes distress at work,"The aim of this paper is to explore the collateral effects of project-based management. Our purpose is not to deny the value of projects to corporate performance but to encourage companies to pay greater attention to the collateral effects this form of management causes for both individuals and groups. To this end, an exploratory research exercise was devised as a means of gathering evidence from interviews conducted outside the workplace but in a sufficiently rigorous manner to guarantee its authenticity. Three categories of risks were identified, together with nine main pathologies. These results reveal the need for a more detailed study in order to encourage the human resources function (HRF) to engage with the issues raised."
Calcagno Riccardo,LOVO,01/02/2010,anglais,Preopening and equilibrium selection,"We introduce a form of pre-play communication that we call preopening"". During the preopening, players announce their tentative actions to be played in the underlying game. Announcements are made using a posting system which is subject to stochastic failures. Posted actions are publicly observable and players payoffs only depend on the opening outcome, i.e. the action profile that is posted at the end of the preopening phase. We show that when the posting failures hit players idiosyncratically all equilibria of the preopening game lead to the same opening outcome that corresponds to the most ""sensible"" pure Nash equilibrium of the underlying game. By contrast preopening does not operate an equilibrium selection when posting failure hits players simultaneously."""
FOLTA Timothy,Delmar Wennberg,01/02/2010,anglais,Hybrid entrepreneurship,"In contrast to previous efforts to model an individual’s movement from wage work into entrepreneurship, we consider that individuals might transition incrementally by retaining their wage job while entering into self-employment. We show that these hybrid entrepreneurs represent a significant share of all entrepreneurial activity. Theoretical arguments are proposed to suggest why hybrid entrants are distinct from self-employment entrants, and why hybrid entry may facilitate subsequent entry into full self-employment. We demonstrate that there are significant theoretical and empirical consequences for this group and our understanding of selfemployment entry and labor market dynamics. Using matched employee–employer data over eight years, we test the model on a population of Swedish wage earners in the knowledge-intensive sector."
Le Courtois Olivier,Walter,01/02/2010,anglais,A Study on Value-at-Risk and Lévy Processes,"The Basle 2 Capital Accord issued by the Basle Committee on banking supervision has proposed a multiplier superior to 3 on banks’ internal 99% 10-day Value-at-Risk calculated for market risk exposure. This ad hoc factor has not been fully explained and is poorly justified by arguing that the standard classical models of stock price dynamics do not adequately capture actual market risks. More generally, the current crisis has questioned a lot risk management practices about the determination of appropriate VaRs. In this paper, we revisit the computation of Value-at-Risk by introducing a new method based on L´evy processes. After a brief preliminary study where jump tests are performed in order to confirm the need for jump processes in financial modeling, we provide a new presentation of Variance Gamma Processes with Drift, that are reconstructed in an original way starting from the exponential distribution. Then, we display a fit of these processes on the American and French markets, before providing a new general Fourier formula that allows to compute VaR quickly and efficiently. Based on this formula, we conduct a study of the term structure of VaR, and provide a discussion of the Basle 2 and forthcoming Solvency 2 agreements."

Faÿ Eric,Introna Puyou,01/01/2010,anglais,Living with numbers,"The disembodying and disembedding of work through systems of abstraction (such as management accounting systems) were fundamental to the establishment of regimes of management that act, not directly and immediately on others, but instead acts upon their actions—i.e. the establishment of management as a regime of governmentality. Time–space distanciation, through abstraction (such as numbers) and electronic mediation, has radically transformed the way organisational actors interrelate and make sense of their everyday organisational lives. This paper argues and shows that phenomenology, in particular the work of Michel Henry, can help us understand how actors live their lives in and through the simultaneity of systems of abstraction and their affective, embodied and situated living praxis. The paper resents a case study of how different organisational actors (managers and controllers) make sense of, and live with, the numbers in a management accounting system—numbers that affect them quite profoundly. The analysis of the case shows that all interpretation, sense-making and argumentation of, and with the numbers are rendered possible through re-embodiment. Such a re-embodiment, in turn, require as necessary a prior reference to their subjective affective life—their own living praxis. If this is the case, as we hope our research shows, then subjective affective life should not be subjugated by the formal rational discourse of management but should rather be seen for what it is—the very source of meaning that is the condition of possibility for abstraction and mediation to be possible at all. The paper concludes with some implications of Henry’s phenomenology of life for organisations and management research."

It incorporates seventeen original chapters on definitions, concepts, contexts and strategy as well as a critical overview and an agenda for future research in social entrepreneurship. What are the forms and manifestations of social entrepreneurship? To what extent should current developments lead to a redefinition of stakeholders' strategies and roles in the quest for better consideration of the social dimension? The highly regarded group of contributors addresses these questions in some detail. They also explore social entrepreneurship from a multicultural perspective in order to highlight the diversity of social entrepreneurship forms and practices and, from a strategic perspective, to investigate the essential role played by various actors and factors in the development of social entrepreneurship. Postgraduate students and researchers studying social entrepreneurship will find this book of great interest.

Gates Stephen,Langevin,01/01/2010,anglais,"Human capital measures, strategy, and performance","The purpose of this paper is to report the results of a survey and interviews with human resource (HR) professionals to identify and better understand their perceptions and expectations of human capital measures' (HCM) content, links to strategy, and impact on performance. This paper relies on a quantitative analysis of survey questionnaires collected from 104 HR executives, as well as on a qualitative investigation using six interviews. Two types of HCM are derived using principal component analysis. One factor measures employees' work efficiency and cost consciousness (efficiency indicators), whereas the second factor measures employees' entrepreneurial and innovative capabilities (innovation indicators). The results confirm the following hypotheses: first, according to HR managers, the more advanced a company is in the development of HCM, the higher the company's performance; and second, in companies following a differentiation strategy, HR managers are interested in innovation indicators, while in those following a cost reduction strategy, HR managers are interested in efficiency indicators."
Kickul Jill,Gundry Barbosa SIMMS,01/01/2010,anglais,One style does not fit all,"This study presents an investigation of the role of cognitive style on the perceived entrepreneurial self-efficacy regarding specific stages in the new venture creation process. Two cognitive styles were measured (intuitive and analytic) and the results indicate that intuitive students' intentions towards entrepreneurship are better explained by their self-efficacy beliefs regarding the opportunity identification stage of the new venture creation process. Analytic students' intentions towards entrepreneurship rely more strongly on their self-efficacy beliefs concerning the planning, marshalling of resources and implementation stages of the new venture creation process. Recommendations are offered based on these findings to help entrepreneurship educators refine their pedagogy to increase the likelihood of effective creation of new business ventures."
Malevergne Yannick,SAICHEV Sornette,01/01/2010,anglais,Theory of Zipf's Law and Beyond,"Zipf's law is one of the few quantitative reproducible regularities found in economics. It states that, for most countries, the size distributions of city sizes and of firms are power laws with a specific exponent: the number of cities and of firms with sizes greater than S is inversely proportional to S. Zipf's law also holds in many other scientific fields. Most explanations start with Gibrat's law of proportional growth (also known as preferential attachment'' in the application to network growth) but need to incorporate additional constraints and ingredients introducing deviations from it. This book presents a general theoretical derivation of Zipf's law, providing a synthesis and extension of previous approaches. The general theory is presented in the language of firm dynamics for the sake of convenience but applies to many other systems. It takes into account (i) time-varying firm creation, (ii) firm's exit resulting from both a lack of sufficient capital and sudden external shocks, (iii) the coupling between firm's birth rate and the growth of the value of the population of firms. The robustness of Zipf's law is understood from the approximate validity of a general balance condition. A classification of the mechanisms responsible for deviations from Zipf's law is also offered."""
Monin Philippe,Vaara,01/01/2010,anglais,A Recursive Perspective on Discursive Legitimation and Organizational Action in Mergers and Acquisitions,"This paper challenges the predominant view that legitimation is merely a specific phase in merger or acquisition processes. We argue that a better understanding of postmerger organizational dynamics calls for conceptualization of discursive legitimation as an inherent part of unfolding merger processes. In particular, we focus on the recursive relationship between legitimation and organizational action. We have two objectives: to outline a theoretical model that helps one to understand the dynamics of discursive legitimation and organizational action in postmerger organizations, and to examine a revealing case to distinguish the inherent risks and problems in discursive legitimation. Our case analysis focuses on the merger between the French pharmaceutical companies BioMérieux and Pierre Fabre. We adopt a critical multimethod approach and distinguish specific discursive dynamics and pathological tendencies in this case. The analysis highlights the unintended consequences of discursive legitimation, the central role of sensegiving and sensehiding in discursive legitimation, the inherently political nature of legitimation and the risks associated with politicization, the special problems associated with fashionable discourses and the role of the media, the use of specific discursive strategies for legitimation and delegitimation, and the crucial role of actual integration results. This analysis adds to the existing research on mergers and acquisitions by treating discursive legitimation as part of the merger dynamics. In particular, our case analysis provides a new explanation for merger failure. We also believe that the recursive model connecting discursive legitimation and delegitimation strategies to concrete organizational action makes a more general contribution to our understanding of organizational legitimation."
Prange Christiane,SCHLEGELMILCH,01/01/2010,anglais,Heading for the Next Innovation Archetype,"The purpose of this paper is to show that innovation success builds on consistency between a firm's innovation DNA, its innovation strategy framework, and the alignment of operational elements. In order to identify a future innovation strategy, it is vital to check each individual element and develop a roadmap for change. The literature relating to different innovation strategies and coordination mechanisms is reviewed to identify four different ambidextrous designs in support of implementing innovation. These build on organizational and individual approaches and match them with different types of coordination. Case vignettes are used to illustrate the different designs. The discussion shows that firms have an innate propensity to adhere to specific types of innovation, which compose their archetypes. While change between archetypes is possible, it only yields success if both innovation strategy and operational elements are consistently readjusted to the new archetype design. Like every change process, this is not an easy undertaking. This paper addresses the need to examine innovation from a holistic perspective and helps to overcome pitfalls arising from coordination deficits. These pitfalls may relate to an overemphasis on personal qualities, a disconnected or detached approach to other organizational members, or a misperception of reality"

Versaevel Bruno,Vencatachellum,01/12/2009,anglais,R&D Delegation in a Duopoly with Spillovers,"There is evidence that competing firms outsource R&D to the same independent for-profit laboratory. We draw on this stylized fact to construct a model where two firms in the same industry offer transfer payments in exchange for user-specific R&D services from a common laboratory. Inter-firm and within-laboratory externalities affect the intensity of competition among delegating firms on the intermediate market for technology. Whether competition is relatively soft or tight is reflected by each firm's monetary offers to the laboratory. These offers determine the R&D outcomes, the laboratory's capacity to earn benefits, the profits for the delegating firms, as well as social welfare. We identify the situations in which the laboratory finds it profitable to deliver services to only one firm, or to both of them. In the latter case we compare the delegated R&D game to two other ones where firms conduct in-house R&D, either cooperatively or non-cooperatively. The delegated R&D game Pareto dominates the other two games, and the laboratory earns positive benefits, if and only if R&D services are complementary inside the laboratory, but only limitedly so, and inter-firm spillovers are sufficiently low. The firms' privately-profitable decision to delegate R&D, when the laboratory participates, always benefits consumers."

The authors finally suggest potential avenues for cross-fertilization between the corporate entrepreneurship and institutional entrepreneurship literatures."

Gomez Pierre-Yves,Moore,01/10/2009,anglais,Board Members and Management Consultants,"A volume in Research in Management Consulting Series Editor Anthony F. Buono, Bentley College Boards and Management Consultants, the eighth volume in the Research in Management Consulting series, explores the growing complexity associated with the growing demands on boards of directors and the challenges raised by evolving expectations of what constitutes good"" governance. As a way of better understanding the ramifications for management consulting, particular-and timely-emphasis is placed on the evolution of expectations and needs in relation to boards and their operation. The chapter authors, as noted above a truly international group of experts, more than succeed in raising the reader's awareness of the consequences that the evolving nature of corporate boards are having on the function of directors, how this function is being redefined by the players themselves-and what all of this change means for consultants and the realm of management consulting. Significant questions are raised and explored throughout the volume, from the extent to which these changes will lead to new social, moral, ethical, and professional challenges and opportunities, to how the relationships between consultants and their traditional clients-managers, administrators and employees-might evolve. As management consultants become more actively involved in governance issues, their role will clearly change, but will such changes enhance or constrain the role they have traditionally played in organizations?"""
Malevergne Yannick,REY,01/10/2009,anglais,On cross-risk vulnerability,"We introduce the notion of cross-risk vulnerability to generalize the concept of risk vulnerability introduced by Gollier and Pratt. While risk vulnerability captures the idea that the presence of an unfair financial background risk should make risk-averse individuals behave in a more risk-averse way with respect to an independent financial risk, cross-risk vulnerability extends this idea to the impact of a non-financial background risk on the financial risk. It provides an answer to the question of the impact of a background risk on the optimal coinsurance rate and on the optimal deductible level. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for a bivariate utility function to exhibit cross-risk vulnerability both toward an actuarially neutral background risk and toward an unfair background risk.Wealso analyze the question of the sub-additivity of risk premia and show to what extent cross-risk vulnerability provides an answer."
Picq Thierry,Melkonian,01/10/2009,anglais,Collective performance of teams operating at the extreme: The case of Special Forces,"A growing number of organizations are now operating in complex knowledge areas and are facing high levels of uncertainty and risk. Literature is vast now on High Reliability Organizations (or HROs) like nuclear plants or naval aircraft carriers, and provides several insights in terms of preparation and constrained improvisation in extreme environments. However, at a time when work is primarily performed in teams, we still know little about concrete collective mechanisms that take place in teams operating at the extreme and the factors that enhance their ability to perform as well as recover and evolve from failures. This paper seeks to contribute to HRO literature by emphasizing the collective level of actions and detailing how individual expertise is developed, and then combined and coordinated collectively to allow performance in constrained improvisation situations. To do so, we focus on a specific sub- unit within the French Military that display teams operating at the extreme - the Special Forces Units.<br>"
Prange Christiane,"JANDA,",01/10/2009,anglais,Charting Value from Global Innovation Outsourcing?,"Over the last years, it has become common practice for most firms to outsource basic business functions to low-cost countries. Recently, this has also included critical core competences like innovation. Beyond traditional cost concerns, it has been argued that accessing external capabilities and transforming internal knowledge are desirable benefits. However, the few extant studies on innovation outsourcing show mixed results and hint at a variety of potential pitfalls, such as capability erosion and revenue decline. In this article, we propose a research model based on the current and future importance as well as the maturity of existing capabilities. Six longitudinal case studies highlight multinational firms’ outsourcing trajectories, their propensity to outsource innovation as well as their respective management approaches to balance associated risks and returns."
Prange Christiane,GOETZE,01/10/2009,anglais,"Tapping the Manager’s Mind, the Use of Diary Studies in International Management","This paper points out the necessity for more qualitative research in international management. It especially suggests the diary method as a tool to elicit tacit knowledge that may not be detected by traditional research approaches. As a large part of our knowledge is deeply anchored in the personal mind, is tacit and unconscious, it defies easy articulation and communication as depicted in the observation that ‘we can know more than we can tell’ (Polanyi, 1966, p. 4). This poses a particular challenge to international management research as managers’ decision-making capabilities largely rely on tacit knowledge (Stubbart, 1989). By identifying these tacit parts of knowledge, new insights in managerial decision making are expected which is of mayor relevance to theory and practice."
Azimont Frank,Araujo,01/09/2009,anglais,The making of a petrol station and the on-the-move consumer,"This paper addresses the issue of classification devices and their role in the shaping of markets. We depart from the notion that markets are shaped by multiple calculative agencies and examine how particular forms of calculation are made viable and sustainable. Classification devices, we argue, are the infrastructure that makes calculation possible and sustain particular forms of economic ordering. We illustrate these notions with an empirical, longitudinal study of a fuel retail company and its initiative to re-classify its network of petrol stations across Europe. Our study focuses on the extensive and protracted negotiations over what constitutes appropriate or relevant categories and the multiple perspectives that can be employed to define petrol station types. We illustrate how a store typology plays an important role in making assemblages of ideas (e.g. consumer-on-thego ), objects (e.g. store planograms), and managerial roles (e.g. category managers) coalesce around particular constellations of practices and impact upon the outline of markets."
Byrne Janice,Fayolle Verzat,01/09/2009,anglais,Tangling with spaghetti,"Governments are seeking to develop entrepreneurial competencies among today’s technology, science, and engineering graduates. However, the creation of “bilingual” graduates who have dual technical and managerial competencies is thwarted by students’ inferior teamwork and interpersonal skills. In education, what is taught is inextricably bound to how it is taught (Dewey, 1916). Current pedagogies in engineering education are insufficiently adapted to student learning style needs (Felder & Silverman, 1988), and the management component of engineering education remains underdeveloped. This problem is keenly felt in one French engineering school where students struggle with a team-based innovation project. We detail efforts made to equip students with teamwork skills by using games as a pedagogical device. Student teams compete to build weight resistant structures using only spaghetti sticks and sewing thread. Their written feedback forms the primary qualitative data for this study. Individual student interviews were subsequently carried out to further uncover potential learning outcomes. We found that students’ responses to the spaghetti game were overwhelmingly positive. Their commentary also illustrates concrete learning of many crucial teamwork processes. Finally, we discuss what makes this pedagogical innovation work and how it should be further studied."
Crespin-Mazet Florence,Flipo,01/09/2009,anglais,Marketing & ethics in competitive tendering procedures,"Due to their nature, their economic importance and the stakes they represent, projects deals frequently generate ethical dilemmas. They often have a profound impact both on the environment, the society in which they are developed and in shaping the industry’s culture (several companies are involved in designing, executing and maintaining the projects). Hence, projects are a typical “playground” where a variety of actors, relationships and stakes – economic, technical, social, environmental and political – are at play.<br /><br /> However, very little work addresses the issue of ethics in project deals. Recently, the Project Management Institute (PMI) has published a Member Code of Ethics and Member Standards of Conduct as ethical standards for project management. This Code however relies on very general ethical principles and is as such not specific to project deals. Therefore, project practitioners have no precise and practical guidelines to “ethically frame” their exchanges with customers and other major stakeholders. Due to this lack of a specific framework, the Public Procurement Directives serves as the main reference to regulate and define the scope of “fair practices” both in public and private project deals (Cova & Allen, 1989).<br /><br /> This paper addresses the issue of ethics in project deals and its implications for project marketers. Based on a literature review, this paper identifies the principles that can ground the practices of project marketers willing to adopt ethical principles. It analyzes the practices generated by the competitive bidding and concludes that the Public Procurement Directives do not actually constitute a relevant framework to favor the implementation of ethical practices in projects. As acknowledged by Berube & Villeneuve (2002), ethical dilemmas faced by project managers are not always solved by legal rules, especially in controversial situations. This paper argues that the strict applications of the Competitive Procurement Directives based on the lowest price bid may even favor the development of unethical practices.<br /><br /> The last part then analyzes the marketing principles advocated by the International Network for Project Marketing & Systems Selling (INPM). While at first glance some of these principles may be criticized for restricting competition, the paper advocates that several of these project marketing principles can be legitimized as a relevant framework for practitioners willing to develop ethical practices in project businesses. The paper then suggests an analytical grid to review project marketing practices –positioning the concepts of ethics among others concepts such as the legal framework (respect of the law), and the concept of legitimacy towards society (license-to-operate)."
Fassin Yves,Van Rossem HOIVIK Schlierer,01/09/2009,anglais,Sense-making of CSR and business ethics related concepts by small business leaders,"Principal Topic <br /> Business ethics and corporate responsibility have been given increased consideration from both academics (Epstein, 1987, Carroll, 2006) and practitioners in the last decades. The issue of corporate responsibility and ethics in small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) has only received limited attention in the literature (Spence, 1999). The perception of these notions in the entrepreneurial world can differ from the original academic definitions. In addition, given the impact of the entrepreneur as owner of his venture, corporate responsibility and ethical issues can take a different breadth within SMEs compared to large corporations. Different recent studies have compared the concepts of corporate responsibility, business ethics, sustainability, stakeholder management and related issues noticing many overlapping and similarities (Valor, 2005; Schwarz and Carroll, 2008).<br /><br /> Methods <br > For this research, we aim at a cognitive approach. According to several authors (Daft & Weick, 1984; Weick, 1995) organizational sense-making proceeds from scanning of information sources, through interpretation of data to action. Mental representations or models then guide cognition and action relative to strategic choices (Stubbart, 1989). We use the Repertory Grid Technique (RGT), a methodology used to elicit and represent mental models. In a very sensitive area as business ethics and corporate responsibility, classic interviews and surveys present an important risk of bias of socially acceptable response. The repertory grid is a proven technique minimizing researcher bias compared to other cognitive mapping techniques (e.g., Easterby-Smith, Ginsberg, 1989) and gives way to both quantitative and qualitative analysis. A sample size of 15–25 interviewees within a population per researched culture/country generates sufficient constructs to approximate the universe of meaning surrounding a given situation, and is therefore sufficient for RGT (Ginsberg, 1989; Kaish & Gilad, 1991).<br /><br /> Key Propositions<br /> The aim of the study is to draw an intercultural and international comparison of how small business leaders perceive CSR and business ethics related concepts, how they differentiate between various concepts and determine which are the overarching concepts. Our key proposition is that cultural backgrounds will influence the perception and that concepts may have different meanings in the different European countries. It also states that differentiation between the concepts occurs in different way according the countries. A first study has been undertaken in Belgium. The study will now be replicated in France, Italy, and Norway, by local teams following the same format. A mix of cultures such of Latin, German, Scandinavian culture will allow to compare the perception and differentiation of the various concepts around ethics and corporate responsibility."
Goglio-primard Karine,Crespin-Mazet,01/09/2009,anglais,The co-development of solutions,"In a context of increased market globalization leading firms to focus on their core competences, the trend towards integrated solutions is clearly established both in industrial markets and in project business. Providing integrated solutions requires suppliers to identify complementary capabilities in the business network so as to complement their own. This research aims at understanding the dynamics leading firms which actually compete in the same supply chain to develop solutions in common and hence, transfer their knowledge and know-how to a competing firm. It explores in particular the role that communities of practice can play in this process of learning in networks. Based on an exploratory case study, the paper concludes on the key roles of two types of communities: communities of practice (role of knowledge formalization and sharing) but also epistemic communities (partner access & development of relational congruence between firms)."
HENNEBERG Stephan,Pardo Naudé MOUZAS ZOLKIEWSKI,01/09/2009,anglais,Perceived value of key account relationships,"Key Account Management (KAM) has become an important aspect of building relationships with important business partners. It is often posited that KAM provides superior value to both seller and the buyer. However, while the research literature has intensified its theoretical and empirical scrutiny of the KAM phenomenon, the perceptions of the companies involved and specifically those of Key Account Managers with regard to what and how KAM value is created are under-researched. This article therefore focuses on understanding what kind of value considerations guide Key Account Managers as they develop their ‘theories-in-use’, i.e. the cognitive principles and beliefs which guide their sense-making. We use qualitative content analysis of 130 practitioner articles and presentations to understand the themes related by key account managers to question of KAM value. Our findings indicate that a majority of practitioners are concerned with internal (proprietary) value of KAM (i.e. KAM value for the seller), while only a minority links KAM to external (exchange) value (i.e. KAM value for the buyer). Juxtaposing these ‘theories-in-use’ with existing literature on KAM, this article provides evidence that managers often have only a vague idea about the mechanisms how and why KAM provides value, either to their own company or to their exchange partner."

Based on six case studies of young technological firms located in the Rhône–Alpes region of France and using a qualitative method, this study focuses on the founders’ capabilities in creating and developing an international business network. The results show that entrepreneurs build on their previous professional experience to mobilize international networks during the start-up phase in order to drive the firm’s activities."

Building upon the organizational learning, information orientation, and entrepreneurial awareness literatures we identify three key elements of a firm's entrepreneurially alert information system, and then develop a parsimonious model that examines the impact of these elements on corporate entrepreneurship. Using both single- and multi-source survey data from 495 small- to medium-sized firms, we test our model and find that each element individually and collectively imparts significant positive influence on corporate entrepreneurship."
Aktas Nihat,DE COUSIN,01/07/2009,anglais,Idiosyncratic volatility change and event study tests,"The idiosyncratic volatility is a key input to the standard event-study method. The recent literature has suggested that the idiosyncratic volatility is not stable through time. This paper investigates the extent to which the event-study method is affected by this economic phenomenon. Using both simulation and real dataset analyses, we show that standard event-study methods suffer from a significant loss of power in the presence of increasing idiosyncratic volatility, as intuition would suggest. This affects the comparability of event study results obtained in two different empirical contexts (time periods or geographical zones). Therefore, to compare results between high and low regime of idiosyncratic volatility on a fair ground, everything else being equal, the ratio of the sample sizes needs to be equal to the ratio of the idiosyncratic variances in the two contexts."
Faÿ Eric,LE,01/07/2009,anglais,"Michel Henry and critical theory, an introductory standpoint","The question we wish to deal with in this paper is: how can Henry’s phenomenology, based on a totally renewed way of understanding human being, a Self finding its dynamic in the immanence of its affective life, help us introduce a renewed critical approach toward modern ‘e-conomy’ and the virtual organizations of human labour it structures? Relying on Michel Henry, the difficulties will in fact not only appear as difficulties to relate to the life-world, to interpret, to socialize, to exercise power, to face abstraction,… but they will appear as the hindrance of one’s praxis, its real, active, individual, subjective and intersubjective life. To support this argument we shall be studying those of Henry’s works which will enable us to ground our critical analysis. This enables a critical and phenomenological perspective on ITreference paradigms whereby exchanges are reduced to ‘information’ (Simon) and ‘communication’ (Wiener) such as they operate in the ‘virtual organisations’ of Davidow, Malone, Davenport, Handy, etc. Written by one of us who has been a participant observer during six months in a global company, a reflexive narrative is the starting point for introducing several insights related to the experienced hindrance of one’s life dynamism and energy. This critical approach leads to a political theory of potentialization and capacitation which is close to Hilary Putnam’s intuitions."
Groh Alexander,LIECHTENSTEIN,01/07/2009,anglais,International Allocation Determinants of Institutional Investments in Venture Capital and Private Equity Limited Partnerships,"We examine the determinants of institutional investors when deciding about international capital allocation in Venture Capital and Private Equity Limited Partnerships through a questionnaire addressed to (potential) Limited Partners world-wide. The respondents provide information about their criteria for international asset llocation. The protection of property rights is the dominant concern, followed by the need to find local quality General Partners, and the quality of management and skills of local entrepreneurs. Furthermore, the expected deal flow plays an important role in the allocation process, while investors fear bribery and corruption. Public funding and subsidies do not at all play a role in the international allocation process. Hence, private money does not follow public money. The IPO activity and the size of local public equity markets are not as relevant as proposed by other researchers. Our results can support policymakers to increase the attractiveness of their countries for institutional investors and hence, to receive more risk capital for innovation, entrepreneurship, employment and growth."
Byrne Janice,Fayolle,01/06/2009,anglais,Corporate entrepreneurship training evaluation,"This paper looks at corporate entrepreneurship (CE) training and proposes some insights for its evaluation. The literature review begins by outlining what corporate entrepreneurship entails and the rationale for a firm adopting a more entrepreneurial posture. Subsequently, organizational devices for encouraging corporate entrepreneurship are explored, with a particular focus on the practice of training. Assessing the effect of training programmes leads to the question of how the programmes, especially CE programmes, can be effectively evaluated. An evaluative framework for CE training initiatives is proposed. The paper draws on evaluation principles from three fields of literature - training, adult education and entrepreneurship education. This study focuses on the 'changes in learners' that occur as a result of training. The evaluation insights gained from these three fields are coupled with an individualized measure of entrepreneurial orientation to present a schematic of effective CE training evaluation."

However, this type of firm is exposed to not only the threats that challenge all types of firms but they must also face dangers related to their family nature. Several American and European studies were interested in the succession issues associated with family businesses. However, this topic received very little theoretical and empirical investigation in developing countries. In Tunisia, the push in favor of private firms was given in the 60s. Nearly 50 years later, those entrepreneurs who had received state aid to start their businesses are about to retire. How is this dealt with? How is succession guaranteed""? Hard as it may be to speculate on the outcome of this succession, can we at least describe its phases first and then consider the factors that could have an impact on it? These central questions to Tunisia's economy have yet to be answered academically. Our aim, in this paper, is to improve our understanding of the nature of the relation between the founder and his successor during the process of succession in the Tunisian family business while proposing reflections to be carried out to make a success of this generational change. Our paper is organized as follows. The first part will be an analysis of the literature on family firms and the succession process. In the second part, we will introduce the methodological aspects of our study, which was conducted on six Tunisian family firms at different stages of the succession process. In the third part, we will present and discuss the results."""

Results show that legitimacy attained through allying with large industry partners is more related to foreign market entry than are the specialized knowledge resources provided by functional alliances. Moreover, CVC does not appear to be related to internationalization. We thus extend research on the identification of resources relating to and the effect of different types of partnerships on new-venture internationalization, and we provide insights for entrepreneurs considering foreign market entry."
Lipuma Joseph,,01/06/2009,anglais,Internationalization and the Initial Public Offering Performance of New Ventures,"Principal Topic : Research of the internationalization-performance (I-P) relationship is dominated by studies of mature public companies, yet many international new ventures exist. Such ventures, often technology-based, may internationalize to quickly recover investment costs, or due to short product lifecycles. This study answers the question “does the performance of new technologybased companies that choose an international strategy differ from that of similar ventures that choose a solely domestic strategy?” Method Firm characteristics are crucial to the direction and strength of the I-P relationship and also to initial public offering (IPO) performance. Internationalization increases a venture’s resource stocks (experiential knowledge, routines to manage complexity and coordination echanisms) that investors may value. This suggests that international intensity is positively related to IPO performance. Conversely, internationalization exacerbates the information asymmetries between new ventures and their investors, and increases uncertainty due to exposure to increased economic and political risks, heightening agency issues that can influence IPO performance. This suggests that investors price these risks into IPO valuation, resulting in a negative I-P relationship. The sample of 184 venture capital-backed, technology-based new ventures that executed an IPO in the period 1997-2003 contrasts sharply with prior I-P relationship studies. Two dependent variables, IPO Valuation and Time-to-IPO, measure IPO performance. The key independent variable is the venture’s international intensity. Control variables reflect factors that may influence IPO performance. Ordinary least squares regressions and hazard models are utilized. Results and Implications : The results indicate a negative relationship between IPO valuation and international intensity: a high degree of foreign revenues in the IPO year is associated with a 41% decrease in IPO valuation over solely domestic ventures. Ventures with low and high degrees of internationalization execute IPOs later than solely domestic ventures. If VC providers expect delayed and/or lower portfolio company valuations due to intense foreign sales, they may advise strategies that eschew foreign market entry as a means of maximizing their return on investment. Entrepreneurs may similarly resist internationalization if they believe that the value they receive at IPO will be less. It may be better for them to move into foreign markets after IPO than to enter other countries early and risk future funding."

Piva Evila,Wright LOCKETT MOSEY,01/06/2009,anglais,Academic entrepreneurship and business schools,"In this paper, we employ resource-based and institutional theories to examine the current role of business schools in academic entrepreneurship. In particular, we seek to identify and understand the challenges to business schools contributing to the transfer of knowledge to enable academic entrepreneurship. Employing a case-based method, we present evidence from 42 interviews with technology transfer officers (TTOs), business school deans, business school entrepreneurship faculty and scientists in eight UK universities. Our empirical analysis is focused on analyzing the challenges arising from the links between business schools and three other principal stakeholders of academic entrepreneurship (i.e., the university management, TTOs and academics in science departments). The findings suggest that in addition to concerns about the nature of their human capital, the ability of business schools to fill knowledge gaps in the development of academic entrepreneurship is constrained by the institutional structures of universities which influence: the strategies of the university and the business school; links between business schools, TTOs and scientists; and process issues relating to differences in language and codes, goal differences, incentives and rewards, expertise differences and the content of interactions. We conclude that if business schools are to play a more prominent role in academic entrepreneurship there is a need to develop internal university processes and policies that promote rather than hinder internal knowledge flows between business schools, TTOs and science departments."
Tornikoski Erno,KAUTONEN Delmar,01/06/2009,anglais,Entrepreneurial intentions in the working-age population,"Principal Topic: This study explores how the determinants of entrepreneurial intentions vary with age of the respondent in the context of the working-age adult population in Finland. The theoretical foundation of this analysis is based on Ajzen’s (1991) Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). The TPB is based on the idea that intentions have three conceptually independent antecedents: attitude toward the behavior, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control (Ajzen, 1991). The relative importance of the three antecedents is likely to vary from one population and from one context to another. Because previous studies have mostly relied on student populations, our knowledge about the relative importance of the three antecedents remains very limited in the context of general population. In summary, we argue that both the relative importance of the antecedents of the TPB vary with age. We investigate (i) whether the level of entrepreneurial intentions varies as a function of age, and (ii) whether the relative importance of the three antecedents of intentions varies as a function of age. Method: The data used in this study was collected in the provinces of Western Finland in November and December 2006. A postal questionnaire was used to collect data from random sample of 5,600 individuals. We received 1,301 usable responses, resulting in a response rate of 23.2 %. We adapted the main variables of the TPB model from Kolvereid (1996). In our analysis we used OLS regression and SEM. Results and Implications: We find empirical support that age moderates the relationship of perceived behavioral control on intentions. Perceived behavioral control is in its turn affected by the quality of human capital. By explaining the formation of entrepreneurial intentions across different age groups and the general population as a whole, the paper generates valuable information to guide such entrepreneurship policy initiatives that aim particularly at increasing the level of entrepreneurial activity at different ages. Different age groups use different queues to form intentions."
Tornikoski Erno,NEWBERT,01/06/2009,anglais,Organizational emergence and external assistance,"In this study, we examine the importance of guided preparation to organizational emergence. The Theory of Guided Preparation (TGP) assumes that while knowledge is the most important advantage an entrepreneur can have, an entrepreneur rarely has perfect knowledge (Chrisman, 1999). Therefore, guided preparation, which occurs when an outside expert assists an entrepreneur’s efforts, is often critical to the success of a new/small organization as it facilitates the development of specialized and complementary knowledge. In support of TGP, recent empirical evidence suggests that guided preparation is important to the growth and survival of new organizations; however, no research to date has explored TGP in the context of emerging organizations. We therefore frame our study by posing the following research question: To what extent does guided preparation contribute to organizational emergence?"

Previous research has shown this pipeline may still be weak, especially for women entrepreneurs. This paper explores the relationships between gender, entrepreneurial education, and entrepreneurial self-efficacy on entrepreneurial intentions and behaviors using the data from different sample groups in three different stages of education and career development: middle and high school students, MBA students, and early career adults. The results of our analyses underscore the importance of entrepreneurial self-efficacy as a key component in understanding entrepreneurship interest and actual career choice. The positive influence of entrepreneurship education on self-efficacy proved stronger for women than for men. Implications for entrepreneurship educators as well as study limitations and areas for future research are discussed."""

Rekik Yacine,JEMAI,01/05/2009,anglais,Inaccuracies within a decentralized supply chain,"One of the implicit assumptions considered in the majority of investigations performed in the area of inventory management is that the physical flow of products that passes through an inventory system as well as the associated information flow are free from defects, i.e. for a given type of product, the quantity received matches exactly the quantity ordered or there are no errors occurring during the data capture process such that the level of theavailable inventory shown by the information system corresponds exactly to the physical quantity available. However, various factors can create a difference between the expected and the effective physical and information flows and perturb the synchronized evolution between these two flows. The performance of such inventory systems whose flows are disturbed by defects can be improved by using advanced product identification and data capture technologies such as the RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) technology. This paper deals with the impact of inaccuracies on inventory and supply chain performances. We first give an overview of potential errors that may occur within an inventory system. Then, we propose a general framework to model the impact of errors and we provide analytical optimal solutions for both centralized and decentralized supply chains. For the centralized case, we evaluate the performance improvement enabled by the RFID technology on such inventory systems."
Rekik Yacine,,01/05/2009,anglais,Inaccuracies within a Decentralized Supply Chain: A General Framework,"One of the implicit assumptions considered in the majority of investigations performed in the area of inventory management is that the physical flow of products that passes through an inventory system as well as the associated information flow are free from defects, i.e. for a given type of product, the quantity received matches exactly the quantity ordered or there are no errors occurring during the data capture process such that the level of theavailable inventory shown by the information system corresponds exactly to the physical quantity available. However, various factors can create a difference between the expected and the effective physical and information flows and perturb the synchronized evolution between these two flows. The performance of such inventory systems whose flows are disturbed by defects can be improved by using advanced product identification and data capture technologies such as the RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) technology. This paper deals with the impact of inaccuracies on inventory and supply chain performances. We first give an overview of potential errors that may occur within an inventory system. Then, we propose a general framework to model the impact of errors and we provide analytical optimal solutions for both centralized and decentralized supply chains. For the centralized case, we evaluate the performance improvement enabled by the RFID technology on such inventory systems."
Nappi-choulet Ingrid,Missonier CANCEL,01/04/2009,anglais,Value creation and the impact of corporate real estate assets,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of corporate real estate (CRE) ownership on value creation for non-financial French listed companies. Design/methodology/approach – Using a pool sample composed of SBF 250 companies over the period 1999-2004, this paper investigates the association between economic value added (EVA) and market value added (MVA) as proxies for the value generated by French listed companies and the proportion of real estate in their asset portfolio. Findings – The empirical results show that an increase in the proportion of real estate assets (over total assets) is negatively associated with EVA, but only for firms in service industries exhibiting low real estate intensity. The regression on MVA shows a negative association with the increase in the proportion of real estate for firms outside the service industries. Research limitations/implications – Recent trends show that many large companies have sold a significant portion of their CRE assets. The underlying motives for such behaviour are yet to be examined (at least for the French context). If real estate has any influence, an association should be observable between proxies of value creation and the change in the proportion of real estate assets, owned by a company. The results suggest that sales of CRE assets may be driven by value maximizing behaviour. Practical implications – In order to maximize the value of their firm, managers should apparently take value creation into consideration in their decisions to invest in or dispose of real estate assets. Originality/value – The paper suggests that in a French context, CRE disposals may generate value added in certain industries with specific CRE intensity."
Sitz Lionel,,01/04/2009,anglais,Mundane resistance as a set of sensemaking/giving processes,This research examines discursive manifestations of “mundane resistance».

Antoniadou Elena,Mirman Ruble,01/03/2009,anglais,Lattices and lotteries,"This paper addresses comparative statics in the consumer problem under uncertainty. Unlike the majority of research in this area we do not assume univariate preferences. We allow a second good to enter preferences independently of the risky good with possibly imperfect substitutability/ complementarity. Also in contrast to standard analysis, we allow in the consumption set the presence of different lotteries from which the consumer may choose subject to budgetary constraints. The methodology we follow is based on the lattice programming approach to the deterministic consumer problem developed by Antoniadou (1996) and Mirman and Ruble (2008), which we extend to take account of the presence of uncertainty. We discuss choice and comparative statics as income increases when desired monotonicity is with respect to expenditure on the risky good, as well as when monotonicity is with respect to First or Second Order Stochastic dominance. We derive sufficient conditions in terms of superextremal variant properties of the expected utility function in the constructed lattices for such monotone comparative statics. Our model encompasses the classical portfolio problem under uncertainty which in our context corresponds to perfect substitutability between the two goods. However, our analysis not only extends the existing univariate analysis to the multivariate setting but it can do so in the absence of differentiability of the utility function, or divisibility of the risky good."

JOUTSENVIRTA Maria,Vaara,01/03/2009,anglais,Discursive (de)legitimation of a contested Finnish greenfield investment project in Latin America,"Despite the central role of legitimacy in corporate social responsibility debate, little is known of subtle meaning-making processes through which social actors attempt to establish or de-establish legitimacy for socially contested corporate undertakings, and through which they, at the same time, struggle to define the proper social role and responsibility of corporations. We investigated these processes in the context of the intense sociopolitical conflict around the Finnish forest industry company Metsä-Botnia's world-scale pulp mill in Uruguay. A critical discursive analysis of Finnish media texts highlights three types of struggle that characterized the media coverage: legalistic argumentation, truth fights, and political battles. Interestingly, this case illustrates how the corporate representatives – with the help of the national media – tend to frame the issue in legalistic terms, emphasize their expert knowledge in technical and environmental evaluations, and distance themselves from political disputes. We argue that similar tendencies are likely to characterize corporate social responsibility debates more generally."

Roux-dufort Christophe,,01/03/2009,anglais,The Devil lies in details!,"In this paper, we show that crises result from the combination of two parallel cumulative processes: first, an undercurrent accumulation of organizational imperfections that lay a favourable ground for crises to occur and second, the development of a growing ignorance that keeps managers blind to the presence of these imperfections. The central idea is to demonstrate that organizational imperfections are allowed to build up and grow into vulnerabilities because they are not noticed or taken into consideration. This managerial ignorance is described as a self-nourishing retreat from reality that decreases leaders’ ability to pay sufficient attention to the increasing process of accumulation of imperfections and vulnerabilities. A case study in a French chain of supermarket is used to illustrate this process of crisis."
Bian Dong,,01/02/2009,anglais,Competitive Advantage Sustainability in a Fast-paced Business Environment,"Dynamic capabilities, absorptive capacity and continuous change are promising frameworks in interpreting organizational competitive advantage sustainability in a fast-paced business environment. However, how to achieve these capabilities, how to acquire the mechanism of competence migration and how to maintain the momentum for change are the topics less discussed in the field. I investigated 40 Chinese household appliance companies in the last two decades and interviewed 50 field experts. I found that successful companies projected various termed strategic assets into its contexts to get access to future business dynamics information; they made the projected contextual strategic assets crossly enriched to root themselves into their contexts along the time; and they set contextual and temporal embeddedness as the goal of corporate development to guide their organizations’ transformation. These are the forces that form the competence migration mechanism and sustain corporate competitive advantage development over time."

Leur analyse les amène à discuter des conditions qui font d'acte isolé un phénomène de résistance créative, dépassant les intentions initiales de parties impliquées. Pour eux, la mise en scène particulière des key people à qui il est de plus en plus demandé de s'impliquer individuellement dans leurs décisions permet de comprendre l'émergence de nouvelles dynamiques qui partent de décisions individuelles pour se propager à l'intérieur de l'organisation. Certaines pratiques, ou routines (taken for granted), sont alors remises en cause sans que des oppositions frontales ou des tentatives de renversement des pouvoirs en place ne soient nécessaires."
Aktas Nihat,DE Roll,01/01/2009,anglais,Negotiation under the threat of an auction,"Most gains in takeovers accrue to targets, suggesting the presence of strong competition among acquirers. Yet recent literature documents a seemingly contradictory fact; a large majority of all takeovers occur after one-on-one negotiations. We seek to determine whether the acquirers in such friendly deals are totally insulated from competitive pressures. Realizing that the mere possibility of an open auction might threaten negotiations, we emphasize the role of ex ante competition, the likelihood that rival bidders will appear. Using several proxies, we find that ex ante competition increases the bid premium for directly-negotiated deals. We show also that auction costs reduce the bid premium required by targets in negotiations."

From a small company with 14 employees in 1988 to a global giant in the telecommunications manufacturing industry in 2008, Huawei faced a lot of challenges on the road to be one of the top 5 in the world. In this case series, we are going to discuss how: (1) Huawei Technologies coped with distrust from Chinese telecommunications operators; (2) the shortage of financial resources to support its research and development; (3) inferior technology and market situations; (4) severe competition from new entrants, as well as incumbent leaders in the data communication market; and (5) future capabilities building. We have designed two cases in this package, which aim to expose the students to various scenarios and make them think about the contribution of strategic alliances to corporate development. Students can generate a lot of discussion on possible solutions to each critical point in 1993, 2003 and 2005 respectively. These scenarios provide them with contexts to evaluate whether the alliances conducted by Huawei Technologies are better or not.

Bian Dong,CHEN,01/01/2009,anglais,Kadang.com: 'Can I customize my future?',"Established in 2006, Kadang.com was created by a 25 year-old entrepreneur, Miss Fang Qin, in China. The youth of the girl CEO is of course a surprise. However, more interestingly, she got 10 billion renminbi venture capital from local investors. Many scholars, students as well as businessmen are wondering how this young girl could raise such an amount of money. Apparently, the business of Kadang.com is one of the reasons. Different from traditional e-Businesses, Kadang.com provides customers with a platform where they can design their own products based on Kadang's semi-product portfolio. This business model was new at the time and there were quite a lot of Chinese who loved customised products, so the company had great potential. But a lower entry barrier may put this company into an extremely competitive market in the future. How could a young girl deal with this situation? In fact, Fang Qin met a series of growth problems. The goal of this case is to let students personally experience an entrepreneur's activities. They will learn: (1) how to write a persuasive business plan; (2) how to deal with imitation; (3) how to formulate a strategy for a growing firm; (4) what the basic characteristics of a successful entrepreneur are; and (5) how to be innovative in creating and implementing business models."

RandV.com developed its original model by introducing more value-added services to its network, thus making it more socially complex, ambiguous in business operation and culturally firm-specific. Disussion on this case will allow students to understand how to: (1) generate and develop innovative business ideas; (2) explore and formulate a feasible business model; and (3) creatively maintain the competitive advantages of an e-Business company in a fast-paced business environment.

Fortin Marion,Nadisic CUGUERO,01/01/2009,anglais,Same rules for all?,"The goal of our study is to identify the rules used to form justice perceptions and the underlying issues at stake in different work relationships. We conducted 33 semi-structured interviews with full time employees in order to let respondents describe fairness incidents in different types of work relationships in their own terms. This seems necessary, as the present fairness motives and rules have been mostly developed in the context of cross-hierarchical distant relationships, and we do not know much about the rules used and the underlying issues at stake in other kinds of work relationships. We find that the relative importance of the traditional instrumental, relational as well as deontic motives, and the use of traditional distributive, procedural, informational and interpersonal justice rules may depend on the hierarchical link between the parties and how close their relationship is. Moreover, some new rules and motives emerge that could improve our understanding of justice at work."

Prange Christiane,HASLE,01/01/2009,anglais,Cigna Europe: Risk management strategies in international markets,"This case gives an overview on the international insurance market and introduces students to several analytical tools. When looking at the role of Sebastien, a newly hired Chief Executive Risk Manager with Cigna Europe, a systematic procedure for conducting an environmental analysis is outlined. This includes an introduction to the specific products and services of the insurance industry, its major players as well as a strategic group analysis. As the insurance market is heavily influenced by Solvency II regulations, legal implications and the impact of stakeholders also play an important role. Data analysis serves as a basis to formulate international strategies in a market that offers a variety of collaborative options, like joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions, etc. The necessity to include an active risk management is likely to change the way these strategies will be used. In terms of learning, students adopt the role of someone who wants to obtain a complete market overview, but is naturally required to prioritise his data requirements and research activities."
Prange Christiane,,01/01/2009,anglais,Strategic Alliance Capability,"Internationalization has accelerated the speed of knowledge generation and innovation. Thus, companies increasingly need to pool and create new resources by engaging in alliances with various partners. However, high failure rates of strategic alliances imply that the degree of a company’s collaboration success is related to the level of its alliance capability. While ”alliance capability” has largely been conceptualized from within the resource based and the dynamic capability view, one of the major drawbacks is the lack of micro-foundations, i.e. an explanation of individual knowledge and actions, which drive the development of alliance capability. A modified approach to the capability life-cycle is introduced, which aims at filling this gap. Finally, some implications for managerial practice and for future research are addressed."

This is even more pertinent as marketing strategies quite often incorporate inherent conflicts between major breakthroughs and consolidation. Consequently, marketers need to balance exploratory and exploitative strategies. However, the literature lacks concrete insights for marketing managers as to how exploratory and exploitative strategies can be best combined. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a framework of multiple types of ambidexterity. Based on qualitative research, tools and procedures are identified to overcome marketing dilemmas and support strategy implementation by drawing on ambidextrous designs."
Rekik Yacine,,01/01/2009,anglais,The Impact of the RFID Technology in Improving Performance of Inventory Systems subject to Inaccuracies,"The RFID technology is considered by a large number of people as a breakthrough in product identiﬁcation and data capture throughout the supply chains. While the development of the different parts needed in order to implement the RFID systems (hardware, software, standardization,...) is under way, it is also important to evaluate the impact of such technology on the performance of supply chains. <br /> Beneﬁts of the RFID technology, in terms of cost reduction, are various and among them, the elimination of inventory record errors that are currently encountered in many supply chains may be considerable. <br /> <br />The purpose of our research project is to develop a set of models that provide qualitative and quantitative insights on the beneﬁts of the RFID technology on the performance of supply chains in terms of cost reduction and/or improvement of service levels. The starting point of our research is a real world observation: more and more companies are looking for other identiﬁcation systems than the bar code technology enabling a more accurate tracking of products in supply chains. Most of them are also interested in evaluating the beneﬁts of an advanced automatic identiﬁcation system such as the RFID technology. They are interested in new functionalities associated with this technology in order to compare it with the performance enabled by the bar code technology. <br /> Our second observation concerns the inventory information system which is a major obstacle to achieving operational excellence. In fact, the inventory information system, in contrary to popular belief and assumptions in most academic papers and in spite of the considerable amounts invested in information technology, are often inaccurate.<br /><br /> Our aim is to quantify the penalty resulting from the inventory inaccuracy issue and to analyze one of the improvements stemming from the deployment of the RFID technology, namely the beneﬁt of having accurate inventory data."

Strategic management competence is defined as a firm's ability to involve different actors in the strategy process, characterised by the formalisation and use of different strategic tools. This study focuses on the small and medium-sized growth firms. With respect to the main findings, we believe that several important conclusions can be drawn. First, the results seem to suggest that while managerial experience is not important for strategic management competence, the CEO's relationship with a firm does. Second, the results also seem to suggest that a CEO's educational level is important for strategic management competence. Third, the results seem to suggest that the entrepreneurial orientation of a firm is important for strategic management competence. // Keywords: strategic management competence; small business management; small and medium-sized enterprises; SMEs; quantitative study; business strategy; educational levels; CEOs; entrepreneurial orientation; entrepreneurship."

Mike Wright Université de Nottingham, R.-U. et Université Erasmus, Pays-Bas La présente étude cherche à savoir si les entrepreneurs usuels, possédant une expérience antérieure du “business ownership”, ont fait preuve d’une intensité de recherche d’information plus forte et s’ils ont identifié davantage de débouchés que les entrepreneurs plus novices. S’appuyant sur le capital humain et sur des théories cognitives, nous avons mis à l’épreuve quatre hypothèses sur la base d’un échantillon de 625 entrepreneurs implantés en Grande-Bretagne. On a constaté que les entrepreneurs usuels n’ont pas fait preuve de niveaux de recherche d’information inférieurs à ceux des entrepreneurs novices mais que, par contre, ils ont identifié davantage de débouchés commerciaux que les entrepreneurs novices. Les entrepreneurs de portefeuille, quant à eux, ont identifié plus de débouchés commerciaux que les entrepreneurs en série ‘(“serial entrepreneur”) et les entrepreneurs novices. Les personnes interrogées, qui ont fait preuve d’une aptitude entrepreneuriale plus pointue et d’une recherche d’information plus intense, ont identifié un nombre plus élevé de débouchés. Si les objectifs que se propose d’atteindre cette politique sont d’augmenter le “volume” des démarrages d’entreprise et de maximiser le rendement des investissements, cibler l’aide en faveur des entrepreneurs usuels — en particulier en faveur des entrepreneurs de portefeuille — est justifiable. Il est essentiel d’apporter une aide personnalisée plus importante aux entrepreneurs si l’on veut améliorer la ‘qualité” du pool entrepreneurial. En fait, autant les entrepreneurs usuels que les entrepreneurs novices pourraient bénéficier de programmes qui encouragent une recherche d’information plus intensive et l’exploitation des capacités entrepreneuriales."

Le Courtois Olivier,Quittard-Pinon,01/12/2008,anglais,Fair Valuation of Participating Life Insurance Contracts with Jump Risk,"The purpose of this article is to value participating life insurance contracts when the linked portfolio is modeled by a jump-diffusion. More precisely, this process has a Brownian component and a compound Poisson one, where the jump size is driven by a double exponential distribution. Specifically here, the bankruptcy risk of the insurance company is considered. Thus, market and credit risks are taken into account. A quasi-closed-form formula is obtained in fair value for the price of the considered life insurance contract. This allows us to investigate the impact of strategic parameters as well as structural ones, as is shown in the numerical section of this paper. In particular, we study the impact on the contract of the volatility, jump intensity, jump asymmetry, company leverage, guaranteed rate, participation rate and level of the default barrier, and comment on how they are likely to increase the probability of early default of the issuer."

Nadisic Thierry,,01/12/2008,anglais,The Robin Hood effect,"Research suggests that supervisors often have discretion to allocate to their subordinates benefits including free time, personal use of equipment, extra training, or bonuses for uses other than those for which they were formally intended. I propose in this chapter that justice restoration is one motivation for such managerial behavior. Thus, allowing the employees to take company-owned time or items or to benefit from extra training or bonuses can be an invisible remedy endorsed by managers. I offer several research propositions concerning the different forms invisible remedies might take in the workplace and the conditions under which managers are most likely to use them. I then describe the impact of such behaviors, and I define the Robin Hood Effect as the impact that invisible remedies can have on employees' subsequent attitudes and behaviors. Finally I propose that invisible remedies can reduce the negative reactions resulting from distributive, procedural, and interactional injustices due to their ability to address employees' instrumental, relational, and moral motives. I conclude with managerial and theoretical implications."
Prange Christiane,,01/12/2008,anglais,International Firms’ Innovation Signalling,"There has been a recent hype in the business world which centres on corporate governance and codes of conduct as well as the voluntary adoption of best principles to pursue sound business practice. Research to date has largely focused on providing insights into the contents of various codes of conduct while only a few studies have adopted a theory-based argument. To address this gap, we use the theoretical lens of signaling theory and presume that adopting codes of conduct can be understood as a clear market signal with positive implications for a company’s reputation. In addition, this research places a major focus on ‘innovation’ in codes of conducts - an issue which has largely been neglected in previous studies. We contentanalyzed 150 codes of conducts, taken from the web-sites of internationally operating companies and showed that 60 of them contain references to innovation. The mere number of mentions might already signify that innovation is likely to become part of industry-wide shared codes of conduct which potentially influence competitive action. However, future research should be built on a theoretical framework with testable propositions. Based on market signaling theory,we adress research issues as well as managerial implications."

Dany Françoise,Guedri Hatt,01/11/2008,anglais,New insights into the link between HRM integration and organizational performance: the moderating role of influence distribution between HRM specialists and line managers.,"Unlike most of human resource management (HRM) research attempting to identify the set of practices that are likely to improve organizational performance, this paper focuses on two key aspects of the organization of HRM: 1) the integration of HRM and business strategy; and 2) the distribution of roles and influences between line managers LMs) and HRM specialists. Building on the resource-based view, we suggest that HRM integration is a necessary but not sufficient condition for HRM positively to impact organizational performance. An equally necessary condition is to provide HRM specialists with a prominent role compared to LMs in order to ensure the required proper quality of implementation of decided HRM policies. Using data from the Cranet Survey, we employed a series of structural equation models to test the moderating effect of the HRM/LM relationship on the link between HRM strategic integration and organizational performance. This technique allowed us to estimate measurement models and structural relations among latent variables, which reinforces to a great extent the robustness of our empirical findings compared to previous studies, which have relied merely on standard OLS regression analysis. Our empirical findings lead us to call for less emphasis on 'instrumental' approaches to researching HRM, emphasizing 'what practices must be implemented?', in favour of an approach which HRM examines the question of who is in charge of defining and implementing HRM practices."
Faÿ Eric,,01/11/2008,anglais,Derision and Management,"The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the usefulness of the concept of derision as developed by the French Lacanian psychoanalyst Denis Vasse, as a way of understanding why people exposed to—and profoundly affected by—violence through recurrent forms of managerial language, can suffer, become silent and find it difficult to voice their resistance and anger. The structure of derision identified in such a context is twofold: first the false promise that one will be treated as a subject, i.e. a person which otherness, subjective voice and desire are acknowledged (openness), and, second, the disappointment of this expectation with the suffering realization of being treated as an object, a resource or a number (closure). Derision provides a new critical understanding of a whole range of managerial and organizational control mechanisms such as appraisal, job interviews, quality certifications, benchmarking, etc."

We hypothesize a positive relationship between the creation of a nomination committee and the likelihood of appointment of directors having a reputation of being active"". We further suggest that this relationship is moderated by the composition of nomination committees (whether the CEO is a member of the committee and the percentage of non-executive directors who are members of the committee) and by board interlocks (more specifically, the number of direct and indirect network links between members of the nomination committee and newly recruited directors).

Le Courtois Olivier,Randrianarivony,01/10/2008,anglais,On the Bankruptcy Risk of Insurance Companies,"The fall of AIG is another confirmation that the insurance business is not immune to bankruptcy. Contrary to the actuarial literature which postulates that insurance firms can survive forever, we believe that this is not the case, and that a realistic and business-oriented risk management approach needs to be designed in order to prevent the actual, finite-time, bankruptcy of insurance companies. In this article we model the surplus process of an insurance firm firstly by a stable L´evy process, secondly by a double exponential compound Poisson process. We compute finite-time survival and bankruptcy probabilities under such hypotheses. To achieve this, we make use of the Wiener-Hopf factorization and compute bankruptcy formulas written in terms of inverse Laplace transforms. The Abate and Whitt, and Gaver-Stehfest algorithms are used to obtain numerical estimations."

The broad principles of protection from harm and deception are identified. This review is used to frame a research design encompassing web site observation and qualitative data collection from children and parents. // Findings – A great deal of advertising is poorly labelled and deceptively integrated into content. Most sites visited by children are created for an adult audience which means 25 percent of adverts were for dating, gambling, loans, surgery and age-restricted products. There was also evidence of pester power, dubious ‘‘free’’ offers and incitement to make impulse purchases using mobile phone credit. // Research limitations/implications – Surveys of commercial activity on children’s web sites must be ongoing as technology, advertising techniques and regulation change at a fast pace. // Practical implications – Companies which attract a child audience (inadvertently or not) should revise their strategy for selling advertising space. Advertisers should review otentially deceptive techniques such as advergames, product placements and embedded commercial content. ‘‘Wish lists’’ should be reviewed in the light of guidelines on pester power. Online payment methods available to children should be reviewed. // Originality/value – This is one of the first overall assessments of the commercial content of UK children’s web sites. // Keywords Internet, Children (age groups), Advertising, Regulation"
Prange Christiane,CELLARD,01/10/2008,anglais,International Ambidexterity,"Strategies of internationalization have long been in the focus of international business and global strategy research. While two of the major theories – process theory and new venture theory – have provided substantial input into selected types of internationalization processes, they have only selectively explained the contradictory results of international growth and profitability. Adopting a dynamic capability perspective, we argue that there are two classes of explorative and exploitative capabilities differentially linked to these output variables. Consistent with the dynamic capability view, we introduce a framework of third-order capabilities in order to maximize internationalization performance. Findings from five case studies are used to examine this framework."

Bernard Carole,Le Courtois Quittard-Pinon,01/09/2008,anglais,Pricing derivatives with barriers in a stochastic interest rate environment,"This paper develops a general valuation approach to price barrier options when the term structure of interest rates is stochastic. These products’ barriers may be constant or stochastic, in particular we examine the case of discounted barriers (at the instantaneous interest rate). So, in practice, we extend Rubinstein and Reiner [1991. Breaking down the barriers. Risk 4(8), 28–35], who give closed-form formulas for pricing barrier options in a Black and Scholes context, to the case of a Vasicek modeling of interest rates. We are therefore in the situation of pricing barrier options semi-explicitly or explicitly (depending on the shape of the barrier) with stochastic Vasicek interest rates. The model is illustrated with a specific contract, an up and out call with rebate, hence a typical barrier option. This example is merely here to show how any standard barrier option can be priced and its Greeks be obtained in such a context. The validity of the approximation is analyzed and the sensitivity to the barrier level and to discretization schemes are also derived."

Guedri Zied,Hollandts,01/09/2008,anglais,Beyond Dichotomy: The Curvilinear Impact of Employee Ownership on Firm Performance,"Research Question/Issue: This study examines the impact of employee stock ownership and board employeerepresentation on firm performance. Research Findings/Results: Results drawn from a longitudinal analysis of a sample of 230 French firms over the period 2000–2005 provide support for an inverted U-shaped relationship between employee ownership and accounting-based performance measures. However, this relationship is not supported when a market-based performance measure is used.We also found that the inflection point of the inverted U-shaped relationship between employee ownership and firm performance does not depend upon the level of employee representation on the board. Theoretical Implications: This study addresses the inconsistency of results found so far in the literature examining the performance implications of employee ownership by proposing a theoretical framework and providing empirical support for the hypothesis suggesting that the relationship between employee ownership and firm performance is not linear, but indeed, has an inverted U-shape. Practical Implications: In a governance context characterized by a spectacular increase in employee ownership fostered by a pervasive support from both managers and government, our results suggest that performance implications of employee ownership are positive up to a certain point, after which the marginal effect of employee ownership on firm performance becomes negative. As a result, our findings suggest that managers and shareholders should be careful when launching and increasing the level of employee ownership to not go beyond specific inflection points."
Tornikoski Erno,,01/09/2008,anglais,Legitimating characteristics and firm emergence,"Most of the organizational theories take the existence of organizations for granted. Thus, attempts to understand success and failure at the nascent firm stage have often been conducted without an underlying theory to explain why some nascent firms succeed in becoming new firms while others do not. This study proposes that institutional theory offers an explanatory framework to explain firm emergence. Specifically, we argue that nascent firm becomes new firm thanks to resource endowments. The reliance on legitimating characteristics will grant a nascent firm an access to critical resources necessary for its emergence.We explore these ideas empirically and find support for our basic arguments. <br>Keywords: Entrepreneurship; firm emergence; nascent entrepreneurs; nascent firms; legitimacy; legitimating characteristics; institutional theory; PLS estimation."
Bruyaka Olga,,01/07/2008,anglais,Alliance portfolio diversity and market scope,"The present study aims at contributing to the on-going debate on the benefits and disadvantages of organizational diversity by exploring the following research questions: What role do alliance portfolio diversity(APD) and market scope(MS) play in small high-tech firms’ exits? and How do firms balance these types of diversity in their struggle for survival? Several reasons have motivated this research. First, among numerous factors explaining firms’ survival, APD and MS are notable, because of the oppositions in theoretical arguments and empirical evidence they are accompanied with. The present study aims at contributing to the on-going debate in strategy and entrepreneurship on the benefits and disadvantages of organizational diversity. Second, while economic and innovative outcomes have traditionally received the most interest from academic research dealing with alliances and alliance portfolios, APD and its impact on firms’ survival remained in the shadow of theoretical and empirical contributions. The present paper fills this gap by exploring the contradiction of positive and negative consequences of APD for small and young high-tech firms in terms of their exit. Third, in contrast to the literature on large firms few studies have addressed the theme of MS (i.e., diversification) in small entrepreneurial firms, either at a theoretical or empirical level (Iacobucci, 2005). In the present paper, diversification literature is revisited for small innovative firms in order to theoretically argue and empirically explore the role MS plays in these firms’ survival."
Introna Lucas,Ilharco Faÿ,01/07/2008,anglais,"Phenomenology, Organisation and Technology","This book is first and foremostly about phenomenology, but not phenomenology for its own sake. It is about what the phenomenological orientation can contribute to our attempts to make sense of complex contemporary phenomena such as the lived experience of technology and contemporary organisational practices. The purpose of this book is to turn back and orient ourselves towards the ongoing meaningful and subjectively lived experience of those phenomena ? to return to the (meaning of) things themselves. This was indeed the desire that underpinned the creation of the workgroup on Phenomenology, Organisation and Technology (POT), with its inaugural meeting in London in 2001; followed by POT 2 in Lisbon (2003), POT 3 in Rovaniemi (2004), POT 4 in Lyon (2005), POT 5 in Amsterdam (2006), and POT 6 in Oxford (2008). The chapters in this book were initially presented at these workshops. The book intertwines Phenomenology, Organisation and Technology in three ways. One of these, an enduring concern for the group, is the question of phenomenology itself ? Part I grapples with the question of what phenomenology is and how it might be used. This is a question that needs constant renewal as the phenomenological tradition develops and transforms itself. Part II proceeds by taking a phenomenological orientation towards a variety of organisational phenomena and Part III focuses on our condition of being immersed in an increasingly technologically textured life-world. In 'applyin' phenomenology to contemporary organisational and technological issues, this book suggests that phenomenology can still renew and reinvigorate questions central to our contemporary way of being in everyday organisational life. This is important, not only for management and organisation studies, but also for the phenomenological movement as a whole. The phenomenological project, that this book embodies, can be said to be twofold: (i) it aims at providing a path towards more realistic knowledge, knowledge closer to lived experience - this is our original contribution to management and organisation studies; and (ii) it aims at providing methods or views which are less stark (one may even say sanitised) than those based on pure 'evident objective reality' - this, we believe, is our social responsibility as researchers. In this sense, phenomenology clearly has something to say about the difficulties encountered early on in the 21st century."
JOHNSON Alan R.,Delmar,01/07/2008,anglais,New venture teams' creativity and performance,"Principal Topic: Several recent studies have drawn attention to the importance of team composition for the success of new business startups (Delmar & Shane, 2006; Ruef, Aldrich, & Carter, 2003). Teams are formed partly to more successfully explore and exploit large arrays of new products and services and potentially applicable business processes. This study extends previous research into new venture teams and focuses on members’ interaction processes with one another to exchange and critically assess information about their tasks (Jehn & Mannix, 2001). We propose a model that includes two focal constructs: debate (discussion, Stasser & Titus, 1985) and conflict (disagreement, Jehn, 1995) to explain both creativity and team performance (Lovelace, Shapiro, & Weingart, 2001; West, 2005). Previous research suggests that neither process alone is adequate to explain the group outcomes of interest, but there is some other research suggesting that an interaction may be at play between these two constructs (Crowell, 1986). Method and Hypotheses: We obtained an unusually powerful longitudinal sample of 60 teams with 6 members in each that worked together during the five months from January to June 2007. An analytic strength of this design is that repeated measures of teams to allow them to be used as their own control, and thus, allow causal inferences analogous to laboratory-experiment designs. The student’s completed a 100-item survey four times during their projects. The surveys asked students to self-report on their team's functioning on several multiple item scales. Professors also reported on teams' functioning and outcomes using a similar, but shorter, 37-item repeated survey. Results and Implications: Our research shows that both goal setting and creativity mediate the relations between both members’ task debates and task conflicts and team performance. We also show that time positively moderates an otherwise statistically insignificant relation between task debate and team performance, but perhaps surprisingly, there are no moderating effects of time on task conflict. The key findings are that: (1) new venture teams can overcome the often deleterious effects of conflict provided they do sufficient goal setting for members to know what a team is trying to achieve; and (2) effects of members’ debates their new product, service, and process ideas are cumulative, and therefore, new venture teams can benefit from returning to this process following each round of feedback from their task environment."

Lassas-clerc Narjisse,Delmar Fayolle,01/07/2008,anglais,Entrepreneurship education initiatives,"Principal Topic: We propose and test a model of Entrepreneurship Education (EE) based on an educational evaluation research perspective (Chen, 1990, 2005; Patton, 1997) to assess the impact on the participants in terms of conative, cognitive and behavioral outcomes (Bloom’s revised taxonomy of educational objectives, Krathwohl, 2002; Anderson, 2006; Kraiger et al., 1993). As we are interested in the antecedents to an individual’s decision to become an entrepreneur, these dimensions are operationalized with respect to entrepreneurial cognitive literature (Boyd & Vozikis, 1994; Krueger & Brazeal, 1994; De Noble et al., 1999; Markman et al., 2002; Mitchell et al., 2007). Research has also recognized the importance of experience (Delmar & Shane, 2006) in entrepreneurship. Actual experience can link learning, thinking and doing. Field experiences will not only motivate students to learn current course materials but also increase their intrinsic interest in further learning. Thus, we pose three questions: Does active pedagogy provide greater improvement in perceived entrepreneurial competencies? How do entrepreneurial intentions vary when affected by experiential vs. cognitive learning? Is active pedagogy more efficient in terms of learning performance? Method: We applied a repeated survey design on a sample of 360 participants from two EE initiatives. We consider the first “EE1” as a cognitive learning program (focused on theory/knowledge acquisition) and the second “EE2” as experiential learning (students are asked to develop a business plan). Our key measures were extracted from the literature to the extent possible and we took into account students’ performance. We used multivariate analysis of co-variance to determine if significant differences exist between the two programs on the three dimensions. We also used regression analysis to determine the impact on the students and compare regression coefficients. Results & Implications: Our preliminary results show greater improvement in perceived competencies following EE1 and more importantly after EE2. Entrepreneurial intentions decrease after EE1 and remain stable after EE2. Further refinements are being made to test our hypotheses within subgroups and also to test mediating and moderating effects. We conduct a piecewise regression to test and measure variation in the effects of the two initiatives in terms of entrepreneurial interests and intentions (conative components), perceived competencies (cognitive) and learning performance (behavioral)."
LING Yan,SIMSEK LUBATKIN VEIGA,01/07/2008,anglais,The impact of transformational CEOs on the performance of small- to medium-sized firms,"Although theory suggests that CEOs who engage in transformational leadership should have a positive effect on firm performance, most empirical examinations using data drawn from larger firms have failed to find support for this linkage. Given that the organizational complexity associated with larger firms has been viewed as a central obstacle to establishing this important link, the authors examined the impact of CEO transformational leadership on firm performance in smaller, privately held firms. After first explaining why the less complex context of these firms provides a setting for transformational CEOs to play a more direct role in enhancing firm performance, they then further clarified the nature of this link by hypothesizing 3 contingencies that they argued are particularly salient: firm size, CEO founder status (founder or nonfounder), and CEO tenure. Results from a multisource survey of CEOs and their top management teams in 121 firms and 2 time-lagged measures of performance, 1 objective and 1 perceived, provided consistent support for these hypotheses."

Kickul Jill,Barbosa IAKOVLEVA Smith,01/06/2008,anglais,Sailing Around the World,"Although cognitive theory has been adopted to explain entrepreneurial risk behavior, the complex interaction between culture and risk perception in stimulating or inhibiting entrepreneurship has yet to be fully explored. Explanations of why some people start businesses and face uncertainty while others choose a “safer” career path have shifted during the years, from personal traits—such as risk propensity—to more cognitive variables—such as risk perception. Although all of these cognitive explanations have received considerable empirical support, none of them focus on cultural differences that may affect, at the individual level, the attractiveness and the perceived riskiness of an entrepreneurial career path. Thus, our study aims to fill this gap in the literature, linking cultural differences and entrepreneurial risk perception.

Mantere Saku,Vaara,01/03/2008,anglais,On the Problem of Participation in Strategy,"We still know little of why strategy processes often involve participation problems. In this paper, we argue that this crucial issue is linked to fundamental assumptions about the nature of strategy work. Hence, we need to examine how strategy processes are typically made sense of and what roles are assigned to specific organizational members. For this purpose, we adopt a critical discursive perspective that allows us to discover how specific conceptions of strategy work are reproduced and legitimized in organizational strategizing. Our empirical analysis is based on an extensive research project on strategy work in 12 organizations. As a result of our analysis, we identify three central discourses that seem to be systematically associated with nonparticipatory approaches to strategy work: “mystification,” “disciplining,” and “technologization.” However, we also distinguish three strategy discourses that promote participation: “self-actualization,” “dialogization,” and “concretization.” Our analysis shows that strategy as practice involves alternative and even competing discourses that have fundamentally different kinds of implications for participation in strategy work. We argue from a critical perspective that it is important to be aware of the inherent problems associated with dominant discourses as well as to actively advance the use of alternative ones."
Nairn Agnès,,01/03/2008,anglais,Book review – Richard Layard – Happiness: lessons from a new science,"It's rather strange to find an economist writing about happiness. I don't mean that economists are particularly miserable people, but, as the author himself notes, economists do tend to assume that happiness is merely a function of increased spending power. Lord Layard should know. Founder-director of the renowned Centre for Economic Performance at LSE and world expert on unemployment and inequality, for many years he has examined the effects of not having any spending power. But the intriguing thing about the thesis put forward in his book is that it contradicts classic economic thinking. Having money and being able to buy things doesn't actually make us happy."

An empirical study, based on the 'strategic fit' theory, was conducted on a sample of 59 SMEs. It revealed that international SMEs are significantly different from regional SMEs in terms of a number of 'competitive dimensions'. International SMEs are exposed to greater demands with regard to differentiating their products and minimising their production costs. They also adopt more pronounced concentration strategies."
Botti Laurent,TORRES,01/01/2008,anglais,Small tourism business resistance to participation in local collective strategies,"A focus on tourism destination competition can be of particular interest to collective strategy theory aiming at destination development Tourism destination competition is generally dominated by small and medium sized enterprises and more precisely by micro-businesses which often have reservations in employing such collective strategy. This situation implies that the local tourism organizations which want to develop their destination through a collective strategy have to have a good knowledge of these type of organizations. The aim of this paper is to investigate and clarify such small tourism business reservations in participation in local collective strategies. Its contribution lies in the interpretation of such resistance in relation to the 'proximity management' of small and medium-sized enterprises theory, Illustrated by the demonstration of the strategy used by a seaside destination in the south of France."
Courpasson David,,01/01/2008,anglais,Domination,"Domination is undoubtedly one of the most ancient political concepts. It is also an eternal feature of societies and organizations. Nobody can conceal the fact that in the long run, every type of society rests upon a social and political equilibrium established upon institutionalized kinds of relationship that Weber termed “domination.” Usually, domination is defined as a relationship where A affects B in a manner contrary to B's interests. Using the concept of domination obliges one, therefore, immediately to account for the astonishing variety of the mechanisms and practices of domination. If domination can be understood at first glance as the structuration of patterns of command and obedience, institutionalizing the dissymmetry between social actors within a given polity, the ways through which this structure is designed, maintained, and eventually, legitimized or contested are diverse and numerous. Among the manifold types of domination that have been put forward over the last ..."

This question is of concern to the millions of citizens whose lives depend upon the fate of business corporations. The rules, institutions and practices of corporate governance define the limits of the power to direct, and determine under what conditions this power is acceptable. Effective corporate governance has long been defined in terms of economic performance. More recent studies have focused on philosophical, political and historical analyses. Entrepreneurs and Democracy unites these strands of inquiry - the legitimacy of power, the evolution of multiple forms of governance and the economics of performance - and proposes a framework for future study. It explores the opposing tensions of entrepreneurial force and social fragmentation that form the basis of legitimate corporate governance in modern societies. In doing so, it identifies a common logic that links both the democratization of corporate governance and the growth of economic performance."

Whereas, locating one’s units close to competitors’ brings positive agglomeration externalities, locating one’s units far away from others’ allows local monopolies through spatial differentiation. We examine location strategies of the two biggest hamburger restaurant chains—namely McDonald’s and Quick—in Paris between 1984 and 2004. Results show that competitive standings impact locational strategy choices. The market leader favors spatial differentiation, thus preempting premium locations. Conversely, the challenger favors locations close to the leader, thus aiming at agglomeration externalities."

Salle Robert,Cova,01/01/2008,anglais,Creating superior value through network offering,"This paper draws on the experiences of project marketing and solution selling to improve the understanding of how to create superior value for customers. Project marketing and solution selling have both developed approaches to deal with complex marketing situations for a number of years now. The upstream mobilization of customer network actors and the downstream enlargement of the content and scope of the offering are the key features of these approaches. This paper presents two case studies to focus attention on elements that are crucial to this twin-track approach. The downstream extension of the offering relies on services supporting the customer's action (SSC), which supplement traditional services that support the supplier's product (SSP). The upstream extension leads to an introduction to other types of services or elements of the offering – the services supporting the customer's network actors (SSCN. Furthermore, the paper proposes a marketing process that takes the supplier's viewpoint, for whom the entire approach is a network mobilization, into account. This approach to the offering, which included SSP, SSC, and SSCN, is typical of a network strategy in which the supplier recruits and enrolls new actors to (re)model the buying center. This marketing process is in tune with the latest developments of the service-dominant (S-D) logic, as it proposes a move from the value chain toward a value-creation network/constellation. Consequently, creating superior value for customer means mobilizing and servicing actors far beyond the boundaries of the buying center, supply chain, and customer solution net"
Steinberg Alexandra,,01/01/2008,anglais,Exploring the Dynamics of Creative Knowledge Emergence,"This article argues for the need to scrutinize meta-theoretical assumptions about creation in order to develop the analytical power of explorative social research on the emergence of new knowledge. At the example of a case study on innovation in e-business entrepreneurship, this article highlights limitations of the Hegelian dialectic logic when wanting to account for the emergence of creative and non-traditional ways of thinking and practicing. Social psychological accounts of the dynamics of knowledge creation have historically given greater importance to social meaning construction than to non-mediated dynamics, stressing contradictions and tensions in shared social themes as central tenets of the dynamics of change. The logic of dialectics focuses our attention on emergence in processes of social legitimisation and re-interpretation of the already-meaningful which produces and reproduces familiar meaningful patterns. The Deleuzian ontology of becoming is forwarded as a way to highlight the central role of non-dialectic, discontinually emergent dynamics. Specifically its logic of assemblages proved invaluable in surfacing creative patterns of new combinations. // Keywords: Deleuzian Ontology, Hegelian Dialectics, Assemblage, Difference-In Itself, Entrepreneurship, Emergence of New Knowledge."

Nine general camps - (i) negative model, (ii) positive and linear model, (iii) positive but with decreasing performance model, (iv) positive and negative model, (v) undetermined relationship, (vi) standard-U-shaped relationship, (vii) inverted-U-shaped relationship, (viii) horizontal-S-shaped relationship, (ix) inverted-S-shaped relationship - explaining the relationship between internationalization and performance were built in the former studies. In this paper, basing primarily on organisational learning and resource-based theories, we develop an integrator model which permits to specify the nature of the relationship. The construction of our integrator model is carried out from two research perspectives, one being deterministic and the other, dynamic.<br /><br /> At the conceptual level, the results of our work allow: (a) to clarify the different effects of the individual dimensions of the degree of internationalization on financial performance; (b) to determine the joint effects of various degrees and directions of internationalization on performance, and thus to reconcile the dispersed results of prior research; (c) to understand the crucial role of human capability and motivation in the conduct of internationalization."
Bouchard Véronique,,01/10/2007,anglais,Modeling the 360° innovating firm as a Multiple System or Collective Being,"Confronted with fast changing technologies and markets and with increasing competitive pressures, firms are now required to innovate fast and continuously. In order to do so, several firms superpose an intrapreneurial layer (IL) to their formal organization (FO). The two systems are in complex relations: the IL is embedded in the FO, sharing human, financial and technical components, but strongly diverges from it when it comes to representation, structure, values and behavior of the shared components. Furthermore, the two systems simultaneously cooperate and compete. In the long run, the organizational dynamics usually end to the detriment of the intrapreneurial layer, which remains marginal or regresses after an initial period of boom. The concepts of Multiple Systems and Collective Beings, proposed by Minati and Pessa, can help students of the firm adopt a different viewpoint on this issue. These concepts can help them move away from a rigid, Manichean view of the two systems' respective functions and roles towards a more fluid and elaborate vision of their relations, allowing for greater flexibility and coherence."

BOUCHIKHI Hamid,Tornikoski,01/09/2007,anglais,Exploration and exploitation under resource scarcity,"Abernathy (1978) and March (1991) inspired a continuous stream of research on how managers can balance operating efficiency through better exploitation of existing resources with innovation and exploration of uncharted waters. While organization scholars have eagerly embraced the necessity of exploitation and exploration to firms’ survival and growth, the theory has raised challenging specification issues in empirical research. In the introduction to a recent research forum in the Academy of Management Journal, Gupta et al. (2006) flagged the need for further investigation of the temporal dynamics of exploration and exploitation. The present research examines the temporal interplay of exploration and exploitation in the aftermath of entrepreneurial succession in SMEs. Prior research has shown that exploration and exploitation can co-exist and are, indeed, necessary for long term survival and growth. However, researchers disagree on whether firms can pursue both simultaneously or sequentially. March (1991) contended that, under resource scarcity, organizations can not engage in exploitation and exploration simultaneously, but sequentially. Granted that March’s argument for sequential balancing under resource scarcity could be verified empirically, we still would have to understand why organizations would opt for exploitation or exploration at a particular time. Entrepreneurial succession at in SMEs is a good context for testing March’s conjecture. Indeed, new owners of SME typically operate under resource scarcity. Further, they have to make choices as where to focus in the period following the acquisition: exploration or exploitation or a combination of both."
Bruyaka Olga,,01/09/2007,anglais,The effect of alliance portfolio diversity on biotech firms' exit,"High-tech industries have always been of interest for private capitals and governments because of their promising economic opportunities and scientific progress. However, these industries have also been associated with high rates of firms’ exit. The most commonly cited reasons for that are the liabilities of newness and/or smallness, since the majority of firms in high-tech industries (e.g., biotech sector) tend to be small and relatively young. Previous academic research in entrepreneurship and strategy pointed towards the necessity for small firms to build an appropriate alliance portfolio in order to survive and grow (Powell et al., 1996; Baum, Calabrese, and Silverman, 2000; George et al., 2001). The present paper deals with a particular alliance portfolio characteristic – alliance portfolio diversity (APD). Two related research questions are targeted: What is the impact of APD on biotech-firms’ exit? How does APD shape biotech firms’ resource-based advantage? The present paper studies these questions through theoretical lenses of the extended resource-based view (RBV) for interconnected firms. It permits to consider alliances as specific resources and regard APD as valuable, rare and difficult to imitate resource characteristic."

Larger and older firms react in the opposite way by raising their level of growth if performance falls short of their aspiration level, as predicted by the behavioral theory of the firm. Our findings suggests that as firms grow and age, they alter their risk behavior."
Tornikoski Erno,NEWBERT,01/09/2007,anglais,"Networks, networking activity, and organizational emergence","Despite the widely shared belief that networks are essential to organizational emergence, the central propositions of network theory have received less than compelling support in an entrepreneurial context (Hoang & Antoncic 2003). In response, we conduct an empirical analysis of emerging organizations in order to arrive at answers to the following research questions: (1) can entrepreneurs create new organizations by relying on their existing social networks, or must the entrepreneur enlarge that network during the gestation period and (2) how does the nature of an entrepreneur’s social network (such as its content, governance, and/or structure) affect the likelihood that the organization will emerge and the necessity of networking activity? The results of our analysis suggests that (1) while initial the structure of the network is not predictive of emergence, the content is and (2) that the benefit of any increase in the size of the network may be moderated by the initial structure (size and tie strength) and content of the network. We believe that these findings can inform both academics seeking to corroborate network theory in an entrepreneurial context as well as practitioners faced with the daunting task of creating a new organization with limited resources. <br>KEYWORDS: networks, social networks, entrepreneurial process"
WETTER Erik,Delmar,01/09/2007,anglais,Patterns of performance in new firms,"Scholars agree on the importance of new firms in knowledge-intensive fields for creating economic development and growth, yet there is still not a refined framework for assessing and predicting new firm performance. Absorptive Capacity (ACAP) is the capability of a firm to discover, recombine, and exploit technological knowledge internal and external to the firm, and it has been shown to be a relevant predictor of performance in knowledge-intensive fields such as biotechnology. Common operationalizations of ACAP are less useful when assessing the performance of new firms. This paper proposes the proportion of employees with technology or science education as an alternative measure for potential ACAP and patent data as a proxy for realized ACAP. Applying these measures on a full population of knowledgeintensive start-ups we find that ACAP is a relevant construct when predicting survival and multiple aspects of new firm performance, and that proportion of employees with university-level technology/science education seems to be a working and reliable operationalization."

Gomez Pierre-Yves,Guedri Hollandts,01/08/2007,anglais,Beyond Dichotomy,"This study examines the impact of employee stock ownership and board employee representation on firm performance. Research Findings/Results: Results drawn from a longitudinal analysis of a sample of 230 French firms over the period 2000-2005 provide support for an inverted U-shaped relationship between employee ownership and accounting-based performance measures. However, this relationship is not supported when a market-based performance measure is used. We also found that the inflection point of the inverted U-shaped relationship between employee ownership and firm performance does not depend upon the level of employee representation on the board. Theoretical Implications: This study addresses the inconsistency of results found so far in the literature examining the performance implications of employee ownership by proposing a theoretical framework and providing empirical support for the hypothesis suggesting that the relationship between employee ownership and firm performance is not linear, but indeed, has an inverted U-shape. Practical Implications: In a governance context characterized by a spectacular increase in employee ownership fostered by a pervasive support from both managers and government, our results suggest that performance implications of employee ownership are positive up to a certain point, after which the marginal effect of employee ownership on firm performance becomes negative. As a result, our findings suggest that managers and shareholders should be careful when launching and increasing the level of employee ownership to not go beyond specific inflection points."
Malevergne Yannick,Sornette,01/08/2007,anglais,Self-consistent asset pricing models,"We discuss the foundations of factor or regression models in the light of the self-consistency condition that the market portfolio (and more generally the risk factors) is (are) constituted of the assets whose returns it is (they are) supposed to explain. As already reported in several articles, self-consistency implies correlations between the return disturbances. As a consequence, the alphas and betas of the factor model are unobservable. Self-consistency leads to renormalized betas with zero effective alphas, which are observable with standard OLS regressions. When the conditions derived from internal consistency are not met, the model is necessarily incomplete, which means that some sources of risk cannot be replicated (or hedged) by a portfolio of stocks traded on the market, even for infinite economies. Analytical derivations and numerical simulations show that, for arbitrary choices of the proxy which are different from the true market portfolio, a modified linear regression holds with a non-zero value αi at the origin between an asset i's return and the proxy's return. Self-consistency also introduces “orthogonality” and “normality” conditions linking the betas, alphas (as well as the residuals) and the weights of the proxy portfolio. Two diagnostics based on these orthogonality and normality conditions are implemented on a basket of 323 assets which have been components of the S&P500 in the period from January 1990 to February 2005. These two diagnostics show interesting departures from dynamical self-consistency starting about 2 years before the end of the Internet bubble. Assuming that the CAPM holds with the self-consistency condition, the OLS method automatically obeys the resulting orthogonality and normality conditions and therefore provides a simple way to self-consistently assess the parameters of the model by using proxy portfolios made only of the assets which are used in the CAPM regressions. Finally, the factor decomposition with the self-consistency condition derives a risk-factor decomposition in the multi-factor case which is identical to the principal component analysis (PCA), thus providing a direct link between model-driven and data-driven constructions of risk factors. This correspondence shows that PCA will therefore suffer from the same limitations as the CAPM and its multi-factor generalization, namely lack of out-of-sample explanatory power and predictability. In the multi-period context, the self-consistency conditions force the betas to be time-dependent with specific constraints."

The opportunity we have had of studying a holding company close to something like an ideal type (a father and four sons, by the same token managing director and shareholders) gives cause for exploratory research. The operation of a family business is described from a longitudinal analysis of the strategy and organisational structures. This reveals a weakness in the control mechanisms because of the hierarchical 'shareholder-principal agent' relationship. The shared mental models of the family and cooperation present a system of values based on trust and effectiveness. The objective of maximising shareholder value turns out to be a reductionist conception of the business with regard to the practices of family management."
Nairn Agnès,DEW,01/07/2007,anglais,"Pop-Ups, Pop-Unders, Banners and Buttons. The Ethics of On-Line Advertising to Children","The growth in children ’ s access to the internet has led to the development of thousands of child-oriented websites, many of them heavily laden with commercial promotion. This has led interest groups, parents and lobbyists to question the ethics of targeting children through this new medium and some have even called for it to be banned. This paper examines the evidence behind these concerns, gives an overview of the codes currently in place to regulate online advertising to children and presents a review of the commercial practice on some of the websites currently popular with UK primary school children aged 9 – 11. Most of the sites accessed by today ’ s children are not specifi cally targeted at them. This means that advertising tends to be for products not used by children. While most of these adverts are irrelevant rather than harmful, the fast-evolving interactive formats of online advertising, however, give cause for concern. In particular, half of adverts (particularly adver-games) are not clearly labelled as such; signposting from host sites to an advertiser ’ s site is poor; and there is signifi cant use of popular children ’ s characters to incite sales. All of these practices are potentially deceptive for children below senior school age who may find it hard to distinguish persuasive intent from entertaining content in the current online environment. There is thus a strong case for site owners, advertisers and self-regulatory bodies to work together to ensure that sites are aware of the audience they are attracting and that they make it easy for children to understand quite clearly the difference between what is designed to entertain and what is designed to persuade."
Roux-dufort Christophe,,01/07/2007,anglais,Is Crisis Management (only) a Management of exceptions?,"This paper revisits the concept of crisis within the field of crisis management and puts forward a series of avenues for building a theory of crisis that is in closer relation with the mainstream of organization theory. We suggest that if crisis management still limits itself to the analysis of exceptional situations, it might never go beyond the sphere of exception management and will for a long time remain an isolated discipline with little room for innovation and progress. As an alternative we analyze crises as a process of incubation that starts long before the triggering event. This proposition implies revisiting other related notions that have seldom been discussed by authors: first the status and place of the triggering event that should be viewed both as a fault line and a hinge between a degenerative organizational past evolution and a future of change; second, the temporality of a crisis so as to extract it from the urgency it is traditionally associated with; third and contrary to authors who see in the crisis a collapse of meaning and of sensemaking, we analyze it as a surge of meaning that fosters organizational change and transformations."

In order to address this issue, we propose and test a model where changes in the available information concerning a new venture impact the perceived risk associated with this venture— ultimately affecting the decision to start it. In our model, two important cognitive heuristics influence risk perception and bias decision making: availability and anchoring. Moreover, we hypothesize that these heuristics will have opposite effects, depending on whether the available information is framed in terms of gains or losses. In conducting this study, we contribute to research on entrepreneurial cognition and decision-making by deepening our understanding of how the combination of judgmental heuristics and the framing of situations stimulate or inhibit entrepreneurial behavior."

The authors of this paper share the sentiment that management sciences and practices may drive people in a way such that the sense of life has been altered and people, contrary to Kant's definition of moral behavior, are treated as means instead of ends. Moreover, starting from a widely-spread malaise in modern organizations, they argue how phenomenology can provide an approach that can be helpful in assessing one's present situation as well as getting a renewed perception concerning work and life. The authors demonstrate the relevance of Husserl's phenomenology in criticizing management techniques for they direct us to objectives that are abstract, calculable, not one's own, and distant. They single out Husserl's concept of epoche for its high relevance with the theme of this issue and its different papers. The findings suggest Husserl's concept of epoche (suspension) can be considered as the starting point of a process allowing us to firstly take distance with our usual taken for granted assumptions regarding life and work (bracketing) and then to re-establish a genuine connection with Husserl's ""world of life""."""

Exploitation versus Exploration,"Marketing is still widely perceived as simply the creator of wants and needs through selling and advertising and marketing theory has been criticized for not taking a more critical approach to the subject. This is because most conventional marketing thinking takes a broadly managerial perspective without reflecting on the wider societal implications of the effects of marketing activities. In response this important new book is the first text designed to raise awareness of the critical, ethical, social and methodological issues facing contemporary marketing. Uniquely it provides: The latest knowledge based on a series of major seminars in the field The insights of a leading team of international contributors with an interdisciplinary perspective A clear map of the domain of critical marketing A rigorous analysis of the implications for future thinking and research.

Monin Philippe,Durand RAO,01/05/2007,anglais,Code and conduct in French cuisine,"We study the effects of organizational code-preserving and code-violating changes on external evaluations by third parties - an essential but under-studied strategic outcome. We define code-preserving changes as a variation in the firm's product range that preserves the social code within which the firm positions its offering. By contrast, a code-violating change corresponds to a variation in the product range that breaks with past codes and embraces another social code. Our analyses of french haute cuisine restaurants show that code-preserving changes and code-violating changes have positive effects on external evaluations. Both effects decline with prior evaluations received by the organization, but only the effect of code-violating changes is reduced with age. Moreover, external evaluations improve when restaurants undertake more code-preserving changes than their direct competitors but decline when they make more code-violating changes than competitors. These results enable us to derive implications for research on strategic change, strategic groups, and strategic social positioning."
Yoneyama Etsuo,,01/05/2007,anglais,"Phenomenology of life, Zen and management","The purpose of this paper consists in rethinking today's management systems in order to look for ways of management which are better adapted to human life. It is assumed that a management practice which takes into consideration the characteristics of human life must be accepted by a large number of people and would be effective and sustainable. Today, the overdevelopment of science and capitalism forget individuals and condemn them to alienation. To cope with this problem, the paper tries to identify ways of management which respect human life more. To do this, the paper studies the phenomenology of life of Michel Henry and Zen Buddhism in order to understand the profound sense of life, knowledge and community developed by their philosophy. It then examines Toyotism and Fordism under the two dimensions of knowledge and community to illustrate how their management system considers human life. The phenomenology of life and Zen share some common ground as both consider the importance of experienced life which constitutes the individual's subjectivity. Living experience generates embodied and tacit knowledge for men. The system of Kaizen which enables Toyota to develop significantly is based on its workers' tacit knowledge. In this dimension, Toyotism is a management system which recognizes better than Fordism the importance of living experiences and as such is better suited to human nature."

Faÿ Eric,,01/04/2007,anglais,A critical and phenomenological genealogy of the question of the real in Western economics and management,"Purpose – This paper aims to answer the following question: where does our capacity for epoche, for decentration, for suspending representations come from? This question is an important one if we accept, as phenomenology does, that this is how we can find the meaning of our life and our actions. Design/methodology/approach – In order to answer this question the paper undertakes a critical genealogy of what those in the Western world consider to be the real, stressing how much Western thought overestimates the reality of what can be seen, measured, and calculated, and underestimates the experience of interiority by silencing the real dynamic of development of each person's lives. Findings – Following on from Michel Henry's phenomenology the paper shows how epoche, decentring is precisely about paying attention to this very real dynamic of development of life with others. Suspending for a while the representations and calculations and allowing people to be guided by such dynamic is therefore totally justified. Moreover, because it is fully embodied, this dynamic gives us the power and strength to engage in reasonable and responsible action. Two experiences recounted by managers illustrate this point. Originality/value – The paper shows that phenomenological epoche is not about speculation, it is not idealism, but a totally realistic, practicable choice."
Nairn Agnès,DOWSIRI,01/04/2007,anglais,Children and Privacy Online,"Kids are spending more money on goods and services and more time online than ever before. This makes them an incredibly tempting target for online marketing. But what are the data protection issues where children are concerned? This paper considers child data protection using the concepts of knowledge, control and parental involvement; it reminds us of the DMA code of practice for online marketing to children and presents review of how 20 of the top children ’ s websites match up to the code. While most of the children ’ s websites do post a data protection policy, it is not easy for children to fi nd or understand; few policies are displayed at the point of information collection; children have little control over what happens to any information they do disclose and the common practice of involving parents is woefully inadequate. It is hoped that this paper will highlight some of the issues involved in protecting children ’ s online privacy and encourage debate on how the industry should proceed in this tricky area."

The objective of the paper in IJMR now is to encourage practitioners and academics alike to build their own research on the foundations which have already been built by previous thinkers. We hope to demonstrate that a good literature review goes well beyond a cursory acknowledgment of the other authors who have worked in the area and we present the 'paradigm funnel' as a tool which can be used to this end. We demonstrate how it can be used to go beyond simply listing a series of past studies to move towards the production of a structured analysis of a total body of research which can generate enlightened research thinking. In this paper, the paradigm funnel is used to structure a historic body of research on Market Segmentation. Since the publication of the original paper the paradigm funnel has also been used to analyse Brand Management literature in an award winning thesis by Heding and Knudtzen (2006). These authors have added the notion of 'paradigmatic turbulence' to the original funnel and have applied it to a 20-year period of time."

It endeavours to find out under what conditions project co-development is considered as a viable marketing strategy as opposed to competitive bidding. A model is developed, which is then used to analyze two cases of project co-development in the construction industry. Of the two cases, one is a successful case and the other is a failure case. This enabled us to analyze factors and conditions that can lead to a successful co-development strategy. Factors such as, project complexity, conflicting objectives, lack of compatibility, lack of trust and commitment and lack of coherence between the budget and the objectives turned out to influence a co-development strategy. The role played by the key decision-makers (project manager) also influenced the success/failure of co-development strategy."

When these supporting institutions do not exist, there is what is known as an institutional void."" In the context of developing countries, social entrepreneurs can be seen as ""institutional entrepreneurs,"" channeling their efforts towards creating and transforming institutions that foster both economic and social development and thus help the excluded to participate in the market economy and in broader society. In developing countries, weak disclosure requirements, information asymmetries and ineffective governance mechanisms all inhibit economic growth. By creating arenas of participation and action, they enable the marginalizes to access parts of social and economic life from which they were previously excluded.

Behavioral research by Watzlawick, Bavelas, and Jackson (1967) suggests it is the emotional not the rational content in communication that drives relationships. This assertion is tested using a new research copy-testing system - the CEPTMTest - and the results confirm that favorability toward brands is strongly correlated with emotional content in advertising, but not with factual content. However, learning from psychology indicates that high attention weakens the effect of emotional content, so the implications are that advertising aimed at building strong brand relationships might be more effective if processed at lower levels of attention."

Monin Philippe,Melkonian Rouzies NOORDERHAVEN Timmers,01/10/2006,anglais,"Justice, or exemplarity? Theoretical bases and empirical contributions to post-merger performance","This paper aims to advance our understanding of the social-psychological antecedents to post-merger success. We study the influence of four perceptual variables: distributive justice, procedural justice, behavioral exemplarity and decisional exemplarity, on two post-merger performance variables: satisfaction with the merger (attitudinal) and willingness to cooperate (behavioral). We contrast our four antecedent variables from a conceptual point of view, and develop hypotheses on their divergent effects on merger satisfaction and willingness to cooperate. We test these hypotheses on survey data from a merger between two European service-sector firms. Factor analyses confirm the convergent and discriminant validity of our four antecedents. Multiple regression models suggest the following: (1) Distributive justice has a large positive effect on both satisfaction with the merger and willingness to cooperate. (2) Procedural justice has a smaller positive effect on satisfaction with the merger, but no effect on the willingness to cooperate. (3) Behavioral exemplarity has a positive and large effect on the willingness to cooperate, but a positive and smaller effect on satisfaction with the merger. Finally, (4) decisional exemplarity has no effect on satisfaction with the merger and the willingness to cooperate. Additional tests suggest that the intensity of integration, i.e. the frequency of inter-organizational contacts, moderates negatively the positive relationships between distributive justice and behavioral exemplarity, and willingness to cooperate. Our results suggest that to obtain the satisfaction of organizational members, top managers should warrant distributive justice. But to gain the employees’ commitment – hence transforming positive attitudes into actual collaborative actions – they should also be exemplary. <br> Keywords: Mergers and Acquisitions; distributive justice; procedural justice; behavioral exemplarity; decisional exemplarity.<br><br>"

We distinguish between part time nd full time entry among the self employed in Swedish knowledge intensive industries. Two multinomial logit models tests the entry from employment to part- or full time entry in 1998, and to subsequent full time entry in 1999. The empirical evidence indicates the need to distinguish between part time and full time entry, something overlooked in earlier research. We find strong support for our notion that entrepreneurs used part time entry as a strategy to test the value of their conceived business opportunity without risking their full income. However, our hypothesis that entrepreneurs use a real options heuristic shaped by the uncertainty and the irreversibility of entry received only mixed support."

Our point of departure is that markets are performed and shaped by multiple calculative agencies whose encounters are organized in routine fashion. Our empirical case focuses on the presentations of manufacturers of non-alcoholic beverages to one retailer during the annual cycle of reviews and negotiations that punctuate the implementation of exchange routines between these actors. Each presentation draws on a range of arguments, data, metrics, as well as ways of defining and segmenting the category to propose strategies that either reinforce the status quo or overturn well-established conventions. Categoryreviews illustrate both the negotiated and distributed character of market practices as well as their paradoxical character, at once dependent on stable institutional arrangements whilst continuously undermining the foundations of that stability."

Crespin-Mazet Florence,Portier,01/09/2006,anglais,Partnering: culture or structure?,"Projects are nowadays considered as one of the dominating modes of international business. While there is an increasing number of publications and research done in the field of project marketing and systems selling since the late 1990s, the field of project purchasing has received little interest and has not been properly researched. In terms of purchasing, the dominant approach applied to project procurement is the competitive bid. In the field of realestate, this transactional approach is however subject to an increasing number of criticisms since the mid 1990s. These criticisms point out the increasing high levels of customer dissatisfaction in terms of service delivery, time and quality and call for a revised approach to both project purchasing and project marketing. In particular, there has been increasing pressure to promote more integrated and cooperative approaches over the last ten years and to implement partnering in the construction industry. This shift from a dominantly transactional approach to more relational practices questions the role of the purchasing function and the purchasing manager. It requires both a structural and a cultural evolution of the purchasing function.<br /><br /> This paper aims at analyzing the attitude of real estate purchasers towards partnering in France and the determinants of that attitude. In particular, the paper investigates the impact of the firm’s structure, the firm’s culture and of the project stakes on that attitude. The results reveal that the customers’ attitude towards is inversely related to the size of the structure and to its level of integration in the company. It also show that partnering in real-estate business is still at its introductory stage in France due to the resistance of the biggest “market makers” which often feel threatened by the structural changes it implies from their purchasing habits. The more innovative partnering companies are industrial companies for which real-estate is now clearly considered as a non-core activity due the globalization of markets. These companies thus often evolved from partnership practices to partnering practices without any transition."

We make three interrelated arguments. First, we suggest that international logics are expressed regionally in different terms - which we call genetic codes. Second, we proffer that violations of regional genetic codes both blend and segregate the boundaries between logics. Third, we pretend that code violators’ and wine regions’ statuses influence code violations. The Wine industry represents an extreme case regarding institutional theory, for wine is a cultural product by nature, and field agents are strongly embedded in institutions. We focus on 12 ‘cases’ from typical regions with either a Terroir Logic or a Brand Logic, and study the first code violations. Three findings are noteworthy : (1) Violations of regional genetic codes both segregate and blend logics ; (2) Code-violations related to core-technology segregate logics, while code-violations related to stated goals, forms of authority, and marketing strategy blend logics ; (3) The worldwide status of the wine region and the regional status of the code-violator determine the types of code-violations.<br> Keywords: Institutional Logics; Genetic and Penal Codes ; Segregation and Blending ; Wine Industry<br><br>"

Ces systèmes conduisent pourtant à des façons communes de percevoir la réalité: abstraction de celle-ci dans des tableaux de chiffres, structuration des processus de contrôle dans des horizons temporaires partagés (cf. Husserl et Heidegger). Mais la phénoménologie de la vie de Michel Henry nous permet de rendre compte d’une diversité de postures dans un cadre pourtant identique : jeu politique, négociation, primat de l’expérience… En effet, dit Henry, si les structures sont déterminantes, l’individu vivant les surdétermine par son propre style."

We use a set of hedge funds where departures from normality are significant. We optimize the expected return under standard deviation, semivariance, value-at-risk (VAR) and expected shortfall (or CVAR) constraints. As far as the VAR is concerned, we compare different estimators. While the optimization with respect to VAR constraints appears to be difficult and lengthy, there are very fast optimization algorithms for the other risk constraints. We find that the choice of a particular VAR estimator is less discriminant than the choice of the risk constraint itself. We provide financial interpretations of the optimal portfolios associated with a decomposition of risk measures."

Marketing ideology is defined as a relatively stable set of arguments that provide legitimacy to marketers and the market economy. However it does not preclude contradictions and the dissenting voice of criticism. Marketing doctrine also produces legitimization to lessen the tensions between the marketer’s claim to legitimacy and other people’s belief in this legitimacy. As marketing doctrine develops through incorporation of criticism, it follows that the critical process is a never-ending one."

It is no surprising, therefore, that there is now greater commercial interest in this age group than ever before. However, researching their views is emotive and fraught, especially if the research is profit-motivated rather than to inform social policy. The advertising industry is no stranger to the ethics of targeting children. The topic has been debated heavily since the 1970s and is currently in the media spotlight again with the junk food controversy. The debate over the fairness or other wise of conducting market research with children is not yet mature enough for any one paradigm to have gained supremacy. There are 3 types of behavior that are not ethically acceptable, however: 1. driving a wedge between children and parents, 2. asking children to spy on their friends, and 3. exploitation of children."

These critiques include the new public management literature as well as its inspiration in the new literature of cultural entrepreneurialism. Both promise to dissolve bureaucracy's iron cage. We explain, using the classical political themes of oligarchy, democracy, and the production of elite power, why we should consider such transubstantiation alchemical by confronting contemporary discussions with the wisdom of an earlier, shrewder knowledge, whose insights we need to recall to understand the complexity of the hybridizations between supposedly opposite models of organizations."

Due to execution problems, all products received from the manufacturer are not available on shelf for sales either because they are lost in the backroom or misplaced in the store. We consider three scenarii: in the Centralized Scenario, we consider a single decision-maker who is concerned with maximizing the entire chain's profit. In the Decentralized Uncoordinated Scenario, the retailer and manufacturer act as different parties and do not cooperate. The third scenario is the Decentralized Coordinated Scenario where we give conditions for coordinating the channel under a buyback contract.

To date, however, these ideological struggles have received little attention from management and organizational scholars. To partially fill this research gap, we focus on the role of the media in these ideological struggles. Our starting point is that the media both reflect more general societal debates but also act as an agency promoting specific kinds of ideas and ideologies. In this sense, the media exercise significant power in society; this influence, however, is often subtle and easily dismissed in historical analyses focusing on political and corporate decision-making. In this article, we focus on the role of business journalism in the ideological struggles of the Cold War era. Our case in point is Finland, which is arguably a particularly interesting example due to its geo-political position between East and West. Our approach is socio-historical: we focus on the emergence and development of business journalism in the context of the specific struggles in the Finnish political and economic fields. Our analysis shows how the business journalists struggled between nationalist, pro-Soviet and pro-West political forces, but gradually developed into an increasingly influential force promoting neo-liberal ideology."

There are a million reasons to own a PC, but one machine can not meet every need, so it has to be decided that what tasks are to be accomplished. A Windows Media Center PC is a hub for storing, organizing, and distributing digital multimedia content. It's a recorder for over-the-air HDTV, a music manager, a repository for photos, a DVD player, and even a casual gaming system that outputs to the big-screen TV. This system requires a few other traits besides ease of use. It must effectively multitask and the graphics hardware should focus on video playback rather than 3D performance. A plenty of hard drive space is required for storing and streaming large multimedia files, and a DVD recorder for creating own DVDs. A good processor deserves a good motherboard, which must meet certain requirements. Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 supports multiple analog TV tuners.

We examine venture financing as a staged selection process in which two sequential selection events systematically winnow the population of ventures and influence which ventures receive financing. For a venture to eceive external financing its founders must first select it as a candidate for external funding, and then a financier must fund it. We find evidence that founders select ventures as candidates for external finance based on their perceptions of market competition, market growth, and employment growth, while financiers base funding decisions on objective verifiable indicators of venture development, such as the completion of organizing activities, marketing activities, and the level of sales of the venture. Our findings have implications for venture financing and evolutionary theories of social processes."

This little piece of New England paradise offers nearly 300 campsites; Jeremy claims that his was one of the nicest, on a rocky bluff that stretched out over the sea. The two of them pitched a tent on the bluff, and as the sun set across the water, Jeremy started a campfire. He tossed some wood into an old firepit, doused it with lighter fluid, and struck a match. A fan of cooking over an open flame, Kaplan disdains the use of freeze-dried camping-ready travel food; he cooks the way his forefathers did. He barbecued some burgers, a few ears of corn, and a Western Digital hard drive. Jeremy Kaplan never lets a vacation interfere with his work. Just prior to this New England getaway, a colleague suggested a story about Ontrack Data Recovery, a company famous for recovering data from damaged hard drives, and a flaming campfire seemed like the perfect opportunity."

This article puts forward a view of social entrepreneurship as a process that catalyzes social change and addresses important social needs in a way that is not dominated by direct financial benefits for the entrepreneurs. Social entrepreneurship is seen as differing from other forms of entrepreneurship in the relatively higher priority given to promoting social value and development versus capturing economic value.

And if power is not a figure of the past, at least its classical forms and dynamics should be entirely rethought. This book seeks to understand precisely how current organizations are governed, based on the analysis of three managerial reforms: the implementation of marketing practices in the banking sector, project management, and the management of competences in the field of HRM; and it grapples with the issue of power distribution and political regimes of organizations in turbulent times."

Another masterpiece by the European masters Fayolle and Klandt, this volume - based on the 2003 Grenoble Conference - will be useful for years to come, among educators and policymakers alike, especially those open to the emerging paradigm.' - Leo Paul Dana, University of Canterbury, New Zealand This book discusses paradigmatic changes in the field of entrepreneurship education in response to economic, politic and social needs, and the consequential need to reassess, redevelop and renew curricula and methods used in teaching entrepreneurship. Traditional and new questions and concerns are addressed, including: the development of business schools towards entrepreneurship education; best-practice methods of learning and teaching entrepreneurship both inside and outside the classroom; the design of effective teaching frameworks and tools; the development of entrepreneurial behaviours and attitudes in students; teaching the design and launch of new businesses. The issue of assessing the effectiveness of entrepreneurship education is also raised. A theoretical and methodological framework is used to measure the impact and effectiveness of entrepreneurship education programmes on the attitudes and behaviours of students. Now more than ever, the book argues, research in the field of entrepreneurship education has to be encouraged and facilitated and should drive the activity of entrepreneurship education providers. As such, this fascinating books aims to provide researchers, practitioners, teachers and advanced students engaged in the field of entrepreneurship with relevant and up-to-date insights of international research programmes in entrepreneurship education. <br>"

We will start from a problem statement based on the European situation. It addresses the issue of European diversity in culture in an integrated way using experience of three entrepreneurship centres.

FERNANDEZ Bernard,Mutabazi Pierre,01/01/2006,anglais,"International Executives, Identity Strategies and Mobility in France and China","The strategies of multinational firms increasingly rely in Asia Pacific Region on processes of socialising their employees, who are seeking to develop and reinforce a “global” company culture, without endangering the cultures of local subsidiaries. Specialists have coined the term “cross-cultural management”. A role of “company ambassador” is allocated to a new generation of international executives in Asia whose mission will be to play an effective role as interface between head office its the subsidiaries - and between the subsidiaries themselves - once they have been suitably “impregnated” with the company culture and the particular features of different markets. The repeated experience of international mobility that executives live through means that the individual may well be living in conflict with previous identities. It is true to say that nobody stays long in an internationally mobile situation without running the risk of there being strong divergence between the domestic and residential worlds, the life of the community and the world of the company. This article has been written as a result of in-depth research into the way executives of a large French oil company built up their identities and as a result of a study examines intercultural learning based on French expatriates' experience in China. We consider how French expatriates experience China and what imaginary underlies their perception. Analysis of daily socialization and interaction processes shows intercultural competence develops along distinct immersion stages: immersion-adjustment, immersion-comprehension, and immersion-integration. Individually, adjustment and comprehension support intercultural practice. The ultimate immersion stage leads to enlightened pragmatism stemming from “nomadic intelligence”. Where a researcher in the social sciences or a business man might have expected to have found an homogenous international elite, international executives building an “international system”, the heterogeneous nature of the identity strategies of international executives give the lie to the myth of the large company as a space for the irreversible assimilation of its members. At an individual level, being an international executive is a unique way of living the experience abroad, or rather, several different ways of experiencing identity strategies linked to the manipulation of one's ethnicity in a context of significant geographical and functional mobility."

Relying on the Leland [(1994a) Journal of Finance, 49, 1213-1252; (1994b) Bond prices, yield spreads, and optimal capital structure with default risk. Working paper no. 240, IBER, University of California, Berkeley] or Leland and Toft [(1996) Journal of Finance, 51(3), 987-1019] endogenous structural approaches, as formalized by Hilberink and Rogers [(2002) Finance and Stochastics, 6(2), 237-263], this article gives a coherent construction of historical default probabilities. The risk-neutral world where evolve the firm assets, modeled by a class of geometric Levy processes, is constructed based on the Esscher measure, yielding useful and new analytical relations between historical and risk-neutral probabilities. We do a complete numerical analysis of the predictions of our framework, and compare these predictions with actual data. In particular, this new framework displays an enhanced predictive power w.r.t. current Gaussian endogenous structural models."
Malevergne Yannick,Sornette,01/01/2006,anglais,Extreme Financial Risks,"Portfolio analysis and optimization, together with the associated risk assessment and management, require knowledge of the likely distributions of returns at different time scales and insights into the nature and properties of dependences between the different assets.This book offers an original and thorough treatment of these two domains, focusing mainly on the concepts and tools that remain valid for large and extreme price moves. Strong emphasis is placed on the theory of copulas and their empirical testing and calibration, because they offer intrinsic and complete measures of dependences.Extreme Financialnbsp;Risks will be useful to: students looking for a general and in-depth introduction to the field; financial engineers, economists, econometricians, actuarial professionals; researchers and mathematicians looking for a synoptic view comparing the pros and cons of different modelling strategies; andquantitative practitioners for the insights offered on the subtleties and the many dimensional components of both risk and dependence. In toto, the content of this book will also be useful to a broader scientific community interested in quantifying the complexity of many natural and artificial processes in which a growing emphasis is on the role and importance of extreme phenomena."
Malevergne Yannick,PISARENKO Sornette,01/01/2006,anglais,On the Power of Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) and Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) Estimators for Empirical Distributions of Stock Returns,"Using synthetic tests performed on time series with time dependence in the volatility with both Pareto and Stretched-Exponential distributions, it is shown that for samples of moderate sizes the standard generalized extreme value (GEV) estimator is quite inefficient due to the possibly slow convergence toward the asymptotic theoretical distribution and the existence of biases in the presence of dependence between data. Thus, it cannot distinguish reliably between rapidly and regularly varying classes of distributions. The Generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) estimator works better, but still lacks power in the presence of strong dependence. Applied to 100 years of daily returns of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and over one years of five-minutes returns of the Nasdaq Composite index, the GEV and GDP estimators are found insufficient to prove that the distributions of empirical returns of financial time series are regularly varying, because the rapidly varying exponential or stretched exponential distributions are equally acceptable."

Gomez Pierre-Yves,Korine,01/11/2005,anglais,Democracy and the Evolution of Corporate Governance,"Under what conditions do stakeholders consent to a regime of corporate governance? We propose that consent by the governed in corporate governance cannot be satisfactorily explained without reference to the collective value of procedural fairness that underlies markets. Drawing on the social psychology of justice and the political economy of social choice, we highlight the critical role played by democratic procedures in achieving consent by the governed in modern society. This line of reasoning leads us to suggest that the evolution of corporate governance, too, can be understood in terms of Tocqueville’s well-known hypothesis that democracy eventually prevails in all spheres of organised activity. Examining the historical record of institutional reform in France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States, we find that corporate governance has indeed evolved to make increasing use of democratic procedures. Viewed over the long-term of two centuries of capitalist development, corporate governance is seen to have successively incorporated enfranchisement, separation of powers and representation. In conclusion, we consider the implications of basing the study of corporate governance on the question of stakeholder consent and the practice of corporate governance on the procedures of democracy."

De précédentes recherches ont montré que les conflits identitaires constituaient une source potentielle de résistance au changement. Toutefois, tandis que peu d'étude ont explicité les différents aspects de cette realtion complexe, il n'existe pas encore de modèle complet présentant l'impact de l'identité organisationnelle sur le changement et les effets qui modèrent cette relation. Les changements projetés peuvent être incohérents avec la représentation, ou les désirs, des membres concernant l'identité de l'organisation. Ceci, peut conduire à des conflits ouverts dont ouverts dont l'intensité est fonction du pouvoir des membres. L'identité organisationnelle peut également avoir un rôle moins visible et néanmoins provoquer de la résistance, dans la mesure où les membres vont s'opposer à des modifications qui touchent à des élements de l'identité organisationnelle qu'ils considèrent centraux, durables et distinctifs. En nous appuyant sur les études empiriques disponibles, nous présentons un modèle intégrateur permettant de saisir comment les représentations et les désirs des membres à propos de leur organisation peuvent susciter de la résistance au changement.

Monin Philippe,RAO Durand,01/10/2005,anglais,Border crossing,"Sociological researchers have studied the consequences of strong categorical boundaries, but have devoted little attention to the causes and consequences of boundary erosion. This study analyzes the erosion of categorical boundaries in the case of opposing category pairs. The authors propose that categorical boundaries weaken when the borrowing ofelements from a rival category by high-status actors triggers emulation such that the mean number of elements borrowed by others increases and the variance in the number of elements borrowed declines. It is suggested that penalties to borrowing in the form of downgraded evaluations by critics exist, but decline as the number of peers who borrow increases. The research setting is French gastronomy during the period from 1970 to 1997, when classical and nouvelle cuisines were rival categories competing for the allegiance of chefs. The results broadly support the authors'hypotheses, indicating that chefs redrew the boundaries of culinary categories, which critics eventually recognized. Implications for research on blending and segregating processes are outlined."
Vaara Eero,Angwin,01/10/2005,anglais,Connectivity in Merging Organizations,"This editorial provides an introduction to the themes of this special issue on ‘connectivity’ in merging organizations. The growing impact of mergers and acquisitions on organizations, industries and economies has generated substantial research interest in the ensuing change processes from strategic, human resource and cultural perspectives. However, this research has focused on certain perspectives and failed to interrogate others. In the case of the cultural perspective, researchers have tended to focus on cultural differences between merging firms and how these differences may be bridged. This focus has provided important insights into the dynamics of these processes, but at the same time has constrained our appreciation of the richness of connectivity between organizations and their contexts as well as clouded our efforts in developing new concepts and angles for research. Through the focus of the special issue on connectivity, the strengths and limitations of the cultural paradigm in M&A research will be debated and a research agenda for the future suggested."

Cova Bernard,PACE Salle,01/09/2005,anglais,Expectation management in project business,"Customer expectations management is recognized as a major tool for every project manager. As such, it is of high interest for project marketing and project management. In order to manage expectations, which are supposed to appear during the project, Pinto and Rouhiainen (2001) have developed a model of the nature of customer agreement throughout the project. They delineate three major phases: sales, execution, and operation. On the basis of two case studies and throughout an abductive approach, this paper contributes to improve the management of expectations in project business by the taking into account of:<br /> · A more detailed project phases model than the original one developed by Pinto and Rouhiainen;<br /> · The introduction of the concept of ‘suffering’ of the customer as a result of dream-like expectation management;<br /> · The renunciation of the customer and the stakeholders as the best means to manage expectations in project business.<br /> The two cases confirm the critical relevance of time for expectations management: both the companies try to smooth and make stable the customer expectations, understanding that the entire relationship does count, not just the final delivery. The end of the project would always be charged of the history of the relationship. Although a project is finally and successfully accomplished, the negative points of the past would decrease the satisfaction/pleasure of the client."
Malevergne Yannick,PISARENKO Sornette,01/09/2005,anglais,Empirical Distributions of Stock Returns,"A large consensus now seems to take for granted that the distributions of empirical returns of financial time series are regularly varying, with a tail exponent b close to 3. We develop a battery of new non-parametric and parametric tests to characterize the distributions of empirical returns of moderately large financial time series, with application to 100 years of daily returns of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, to 1 year of 5-min returns of the Nasdaq Composite index and to 17 years of 1-min returns of the Standard & Poor's 500. We propose a parametric representation of the tail of the distributions of returns encompassing both a regularly varying distribution in one limit of the parameters and rapidly varying distributions of the class of the stretched-exponential (SE) and the log-Weibull or Stretched Log-Exponential (SLE) distributions in other limits. Using the method of nested hypothesis testing (Wilks' theorem), we conclude that both the SE distributions and Pareto distributions provide reliable descriptions of the data but are hardly distinguishable for sufficiently high thresholds. Based on the discovery that the SE distribution tends to the Pareto distribution in a certain limit, we demonstrate that Wilks' test of nested hypothesis still works for the non-exactly nested comparison between the SE and Pareto distributions. The SE distribution is found to be significantly better over the whole quantile range but becomes unnecessary beyond the 95% quantiles compared with the Pareto law. Similar conclusions hold for the log-Weibull model with respect to the Pareto distribution, with a noticeable exception concerning the very-high-frequency data. Summing up all the evidence provided by our tests, it seems that the tails ultimately decay slower than any SE but probably faster than power laws with reasonable exponents. Thus, from a practical viewpoint, the log-Weibull model, which provides a smooth interpolation between SE and PD, can be considered as an appropriate approximation of the sample distributions."
Faÿ Eric,,01/08/2005,anglais,"Life, Speech and Reason","Despite a growing interest the status of the manifestations of the subjective body is still controversial in organization studies. Defining flesh as pure subjective affective experience of life the French phenomenologist Michel Henry opens up outside the paths covered by contemporary thought. He offers an interesting perspective to understand body, subjectivity, reason, speech, power, action and work in connection with life. Following this phenomenological path opened by Henry, and also drawing upon Husserl, Merleau-Ponty and Ricoeur, I make a distinction in this paper between reason and rationality and I suggest one of their possible articulations through the concept of open deliberation. A field study which has been the basis of this research is presented."
Faÿ Eric,,01/07/2005,anglais,Derision and management,"While many studies have enlighten several rhetorical and linguistic structures of managerial discourses in organizations, few have analysed from a Lacanian standpoint the impact of these linguistic structures upon the subjectivity of the people concerned. The aim of this article is to demonstrate that many modern management techniques, resulting from the hybrid combination of communication and instrumental rationality paradigms, generate specific recurrent structures of languaging in organizations. These hybrid structures generate what I call here homo managerialis and are similar to the concept of derision as it has been expounded by Denis Vasse in a psychoanalytical context. Derision, in Vasse’s psychoanalytical perspective, is a violent way to address to someone which starts with openness and ends up by closeness. It severs one’s link with desire, confidence in life, makes work a pain, generates false sociability. This similarity between the structure of modern management techniques and derision is demonstrated through the analysis of three archetypal situations. Finally, based upon Vasse’s specific post-Lacanian psychoanalytic anthropology which lends itself to the analysis of derision and from M. Henry’s phenomenology of life, this paper will suggest a new understanding of human being and reason which is the basis for a new understanding of organizing which prevents derision."

We show how the concept of efficient frontiers generalizes naturally and how it depends on the chosen risk measure corresponding to different orders and/or combinations of centered moments or cumulants. Our extended formulas enable us to determine analytically the conditions under which it is possible to “have your cake and eat it too”, i.e., to construct a portfolio with both larger return and smaller “large risks.”"

The case of the video game industry,"The purpose of this paper is to present the results of an exploratory empirical research carried out in 2001–2002, amongst 20 firms in the French video game industry. The objective of this research was to analyse the SHRM of these companies and to test the relevance of the Resource Based View of the firm, which states that Human Resources are all the more crucial for a given firm as they are specific, non imitable and socially complex (Coff, R. (1997) Academy of Management Review, Vol. 22, No. 2, pp.374–402). On the basis of semi-directive interviews of HR operators, the stake was to characterise the HR practices of each company in connection with its strategy and development stage. We thus obtained a snapshot of SHRM's various profiles existing in this sector. We further analyse the possible rationales to explain a paradoxical finding: video games companies, as they grow, tend to get rid of their specific, socially complex and causally ambiguous assets (namely the creative skills) in favour of more generic set of skills (namely, the management skills)."

LUBATKIN Michael,,01/06/2005,anglais,A theory of the firm only a micro-economist could love,"Although agency theory dominates corporate governance research, its behavioral assumptions stand in direct competition to the worldviews held by most organizational scholars. In this article, the author argues that it is high time for organizational scholars to stop deferring to economists and start to develop their own governance theories, for which their conceptual base is far better suited."
LUBATKIN Michael,SCHULZE LING DINO,01/06/2005,anglais,The effects of parental altruism on the governance of family-managed firms,"We draw on the economic, corporate governance, and family business literatures to explain why the effects of family on family firms makes this governance form theoretically distinct from those of public and private non-family firms. Our thesis is that parental altruism, when combined with private ownership and owner-management, influences the ability of the firm’s owner-manager to exercise self-control, which, in turn, can expose some family firms to conflicts rooted in the agency threats of moral hazard, hold-up, and adverse selection. We then discuss why some other family firms are able to minimize these dark side threats and thereby attain altruism’s brighter side. Finally, we discuss how altruism’s influence changes over time as ownership becomes dispersed among family members and across generations."
Vogler Eric,,01/06/2005,anglais,Front Line and Middle Management in Service Firms,"The objective of this research is to propose a pattern to achieve a greater understanding of the strategic process in the decentralized structure of service companies. This process goes from operational levels to headquarters through two complementary conversations: an operational conversation between local front line management and regional middle management, and a strategic conversation between middle management and top management. The embeddedness of these two complementary dialogs forms a more consistent strategic process and reduces the tensions between the periphery and the center. Decentralization has been unfolding for the last 20 years (Martinet, 2001) and invites new players to the strategic table (Whittington, 2002). The 1980's marked the starting point in the trend of strategic decentralization. The well known debate concerning the rise and fall of the strategic planning"" with Ansoff and Mintzberg in 1990 and 1991 was an illustration of this trend: the development of the strategic process, less planned, less centralized, created room for emergent strategy (Mintzberg and Waters, 1985), even autonomous strategy (Burgelman, 1983) supported by new players: middle managers. Middle managers are now fully involved in the strategic process (Floyd and Wooldridge, 1990), playing a central role not only in the implementation phase, but in the decision-making processes and the initial diagnosis. We suggest this trend is particularly visible in the service sector, where the network structure, a common organization in service companies (Mills et al., 1983), reinforces the effects of strategic decentralization (Payaud, 2003). The generic characteristics of service companies (Berry, 1980), such as the coproduction of service with the client, give a central role to the contact staff and the operational level. The Flexiform model (Mills et al., 1983) specifies the level of power and the degree of legitimation linked to the operational level: the headquarters is ""weak"" compared to an autonomous network of field units which implement their own solutions, adapted to the local context. As a consequence, the role of middle management in the definition of the corporate strategy is crucial to observe. The existence of autonomous local strategies in service companies, and the key role played by middle management in such a context, more than justifies the interest in observing the strategic process in service companies: what is the content of local micro-strategies, what is the role of the operational level and of the middle management level in the strategic process (Floyd and Lane, 2000), what are the links in the 'strategic chain' beginning with the contact staff and ending with the corporate center? To address these issues, we interviewed 29 front line and middle managers and processed a content analysis. The first aim of this was to identify the specificity of micro-strategy. The content of micro-strategy is different from corporate strategy: the local manager has different objectives (more commercial and operational), and resources (acquisitions are harder to decide on) and encounters different problems. In this paper, we first propose a canvas for middle managers to organize a local micro-strategy. The second aim was to explore the 'strategic chain' and the contribution of each level (front line and middle management) to the strategic process. We adapt the model of strategic conversation (Westley, 1990) to different levels of management in the service company: -an operational conversation between the operational staff and the middle management, concerning clients and operational process, -a strategic conversation between the middle management and the corporate management, concerning the competition strategy and the development of the structure and resources. We suggest that these two sets of conversations are permanently interacting with each other, which reduces the risk of heterogeneity in the numerous micro-strategies at the field levels, and offers an ideal tool to make the strategy more consistent. This research offers operational, middle and top management a pattern to organize and improve on the design of the strategic process in which they are all involved. It illustrates the strategic conversation between the middle and the top management and proposes to adapt this concept to an operational conversation between local front line management and regional middle management. The operational and middle management should use strategic analysis tools to create more relevant local strategic diagnosis: this common vocabulary should facilitate the dialog between the center and the periphery, and consolidate micro-strategies locally. This research could be useful to headquarters in understanding more the need for autonomy of local service units in a national network and to master relationships when managing the strategic process."""
Vaara Eero,Soderberg HOLGERSSON TIENARI,01/05/2005,anglais,Gender and National Identity Constructions in the Cross-Border Merger Context,"In this article we explore ways in which vertical gender inequality is accomplished in discourse in the context of a recent chain of cross-border mergers and acquisitions that resulted in the formation of a multinational Nordic company. We analyse social interactions of 'doing' gender in interviews with male senior executives from Denmark, Finland and Sweden. We argue that their explanations for the absence of women in the top echelons of the company serve to distance vertical gender inequality. The main contribution of the article is an analysis of how national identities are discursively (re)constructed in such distancing. New insights are offered to studying gender in multinationals with a cross-cultural team of researchers. Our study sheds light on how gender intersects with nationality in shaping the multinational organization and the identities of male executives in globalizing business."
Vaara Eero,KURONEN TIENARI,01/05/2005,anglais,The Merger Storm Recognizes No Borders:,"Despite the central role of the media in contemporary society, studies examining the rhetorical practices of journalists are rare in organization and management research. We know little of the textual micro strategies and techniques through which journalists convey specific messages to their readers. Partially to fill the gap, this paper outlines a methodological framework that combines three perspectives of text analysis and interpretation: critical discourse analysis, systemic functional grammar and rhetorical structure theory. Using this framework, we engage in a close reading of a single media text (a press article) on a recent case of industrial restructuring in the financial services. In our empirical analysis, we focus on key arguments put forward by the journalists’ rhetorical constructions. We maintain that these arguments—which are not frame-breaking but rather tend to confirm existing presuppositions held by the audience—are an essential part of the legitimization and naturalization of specific management ideas and ideologies.

MOUZAS Stefano,Pardo Naudé ENNEBERG,01/02/2005,anglais,Unpicking the meaning of value key in account management,"In this conceptual paper we explore the meaning of value within the context of Key Account Management (KAM).We briefly present the emergence of Key Account Programs, identifying that they have not traditionally been linked to the notion of value. We go on to present value as it is currently explored in the marketing literature, emphasizing the fact that value is seen from either the customer's or the supplier's prespective. However, as Key Account Management Programs are often formed between companies in order to achieve mutual gains, the current view of value (from either the customer's or the supplier's viewpoint) is sufficient to take into account this mutual perspective. We explore different 'types' of value that may be achieved in such programs, and propose a model that may be used in order to facilitate our understanding of how these vary. Some intial strategic implications are derived for key account managers. The paper allows us to build on the existing literature on value, by adding a new definition of relational value. it also allows us to propose a new understanding of key account management based upon value."

La question que nous nous posons est la suivante: pourquoi la communauté IMP continue t-elle à se référer au modèle traditionnel du marketing management Kotlérien. Pour y répondre, nous faisons appel aux développements de la sociologie des sciences, particulièrement aux travaux de Bruno Latour.

Nous croyons que les crises résultent d’un double processus d’accumulation. Primo une accumulation souterraine d’imperfections organisationnelles (anomalies, erreurs, vulnérabilités…) qui sème un terreau favorable à l’apparition des crises. Secondo le développement d’une ignorance croissante qui aveugle les managers sur la présence de ces imperfections. L’idée centrale est de démontrer que les imperfections s’accumulent lentement et se transforment en vulnérabilités parce qu’elles ne sont pas remarquées ou prises en considération. Cette ignorance n'est en aucun cas intentionnelle. Elle provient d'un retrissement cognitif croissant alors que les imperfections s'amplifient et mutent en vulnaribilité.Bien que l'ignorance managériale ait été étudiée sous différentes facettes et ce, en relation avec la gestion de crise, nous proposons une approche alternative où l'ignorance est analysée comme un processus d'auto-regulation de l'estime de soi des managers.

Evans Daniel,,01/09/2004,anglais,5 Sizzling trends in visual merchandising.,"This article discusses trends in visual merchandising. The single most important trend in visual merchandising is the return of visual merchandising itself. Today, every retailer is addressing its importance — the needs, the how-to, and what went wrong when they simplified their stores and removed this key element of merchandising. Merchandising is no longer about simplification. Today's trends are full of patterns, textures, exotic trims and unusual material combinations. No longer can a simple white box define excitement. It may be as simple as adding one bright color to a wall or adding color through product, but color definition will always present excitement. Customers want to know that retailers have a clear point of view, that they honestly present their products and services and always give the best for what is spent. Often, these values are presented best through visual merchandising."
Fayolle Alain,,01/09/2004,anglais,Value Creation in Changing Student State of Mind and Behaviour,"Entrepreneurship teaching programs and initiatives in educating people towards entrepreneurship are everywhere growing in the world. In relation to this development some practical and research key issues are rising. Among them, the question of entrepreneurship teaching programs assessment is probably one of the most crucial both at a social and at a research level. Very often, entrepreneurship teaching programs (ETP) are launched within the universities with a strong involvement of the political and economic environment. These partners are waiting for concrete results which turn around the creation of start-ups and the creation of new jobs by people having been educated and taught through the ETP.. Some research works have been made on this topic and the greater part of them clearly underline the complexity of the assessment question, mainly in terms of indicator choice and also because the measure itself is very complicated due to the existence of late effects. Moreover, the field of the ETP is very diversified and heterogeneous, depending on the teaching objectives, the audiences, the contents, the teacher profiles, the pedagogical methods and approaches, etc. The aim of our paper is to show that it is possible to avoid some of these difficulties by reconsidering and reformulating the assessment question. It seems to us that the most important result of the ETP is not necessarily the creation of start-ups, but could be, among educated students, mindset changes, attitude changes and the development of an entrepreneurial orientation, measured through intentions. We are thus proposing a conceptual framework in assessing the ETP. This framework is using the theory of planned behavior elaborated by Ajzen, which could allow us to measure, under the influences of independent variables related to ETP, attitude changes towards the entrepreneurial behaviour, attitude changes in relation to subjective norms, attitude changes concerning perceived entrepreneurial behaviour control and finally, changes in entrepreneurial intentions. The main research paper idea is to consider that it is expected and also feasible to design a dynamic tool using the theory of planned behaviour to assess the ETP and so to measure variations on entrepreneurial intention throughout the education process. The research paper implications are concerning the entrepreneurship research community. The paper is opening some interesting research perspectives in the field of entrepreneurship teaching and education. One of them could be addressed to the study and the analysis of attitude changes and entrepreneurial intention changes in the ETP processes. Implications are also concerning the entrepreneurship teachers and educators. The presented dynamic approach using the theory of planned behaviour could allow them to improve their understanding of how each ETP is functioning and what are the key ingredients (contents, teacher profile, pedagogical methods, …) and the optimal combination in relation to a particular teaching objective. Finally, the implications are concerning the social and economic world. Politicians and decision makers need probably to reconsider their ideas and views about entrepreneurship teaching and education. The most important thing is not one more start-up by a student or a young graduate, but a strong emergence and diffusion of the entrepreneurial spirit within the university campuses."

Gomez Pierre-Yves,Korine,01/05/2004,anglais,Democracy and the Evolution of Corporate Governance,"Under what conditions do stakeholders consent to a regime of corporate governance? We propose that consent by the governed in corporate governance cannot be satisfactorily explained without reference to the collective value of procedural fairness that underlies markets. Drawing on the social psychology of justice and the political economy of social choice, we highlight the critical role played by democratic procedures in achieving consent by the governed in modern society. This line of reasoning leads us to suggest that the evolution of corporate governance, too, can be understood in terms of Tocqueville’s well-known hypothesis that democracy eventually prevails in all spheres of organised activity. Examining the historical record of institutional reform in France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States, we find that corporate governance has indeed evolved to make increasing use of democratic procedures. Viewed over the long-term of two centuries of capitalist development, corporate governance is seen to have successively incorporated enfranchisement, separation of powers and representation. In conclusion, we consider the implications of basing the study of corporate governance on the question of stakeholder consent and the practice of corporate governance on the procedures of democracy."
Gomez Pierre-Yves,,01/04/2004,anglais,On the discretionary power of top executives,"The history of corporate governance systems is now well documented. It is, however, necessary to better understand the link between the theories and the evolution of effective practices of governance. In this article, it is demonstrated that the development of theories (property rights, agency theory, stakeholder theory, etc.) parallels the evolution of the governance of corporations. Taking three main periods into consideration, I examine how economic theories offer rational frameworks for each period that give scope to and delineate the discretionary power of top management. These theoretical constructs answer the need for understanding both the governance systems and the legitimizing practices in use. As a result, I show how the evolution of corporate governance since the 1970s challenges the use of agency theory as the mainstream model and paves the way for new theories of corporate governance in an era of mass shareholding."

In particular, the use of Lévy processes does not permit building of a complete market. In other words, the risk-neutral measure is not unique; prices will vary according to the choice of measure that is made. Two approaches are basically available. In the first approach (cf. Carr, Geman, Madan and Yor (2002)), the risk-neutral measure is extracted directly from the market -- from option prices. One can then compute derivative prices by performing numerical integrations with respect to this measure. In the second approach (cf. Raible (2000)), the risk-neutral measure is derived by an Esscher transform. Users of this approach (Raible and others) modelled prices on processes from the Generalized Hyperbolic class."

TORRES Olivier,,01/01/2004,anglais,The failure of the Californian Mondavi's implantation in France,"An explanation for why plans to set up business in the small village of Aniane, in the Languedoc region of France, were a failure for Mondavi, the pioneer of California's Napa Valley. Initially, everyone came out a winner. The project nevertheless ground to a halt because of an anti-Mondavi revolt. The leader of this revolt was Aime Guibert, a local wine-grower violently opposed to ''industrial wines'' and himself the producer of one of France's best wines. The interesting point of this conflict is that it reveals a type of entrepreneur that has been underestimated by entrepreneurship theory. Using the rent-seeking trend as its basis, this article highlights the characteristics of the corporatiste entrepreneur, who prefers avoiding threats to seizing opportunities."

Durand Rodolphe,BONARDI,01/11/2003,anglais,Managing network effects in High-Tech Markets,"Many high-tech markets are characterized by network effects: situations where consumers make their decisions not simply based on the core product, but also on the quality and availability of its complements. These network effects enable the creation of a technological standard, which can lead to a strong competitive position for the core-product manufacturer. There is no guarantee, however, that this position can be sustained over time. Managers must therefore focus on further developments of the core product. the best way to stimulate further developments may be to reposition the core product in order to strengthen network effects. A three-phase framework can determine how to make an investment in the future generation of a product for which complements are crucial. First, a matrix is provided to evaluate whether the existing technology presents some untapped potential in terms of network effects; second, how to reposition the core product is analyzed; and third, some accompanying measures to manage this repositioning efficiently are suggested."
TORRES Olivier,,01/11/2003,anglais,Thirty years of research into SMEs: a field of trends and counter-trends,"This paper is based on a long consideration of the concept of small business after thirty years of conceptual development. Most, if not all, researchers in small business have accepted the idea that small business is specific (the preponderant role of the owner-manager, low level of functional breakdown, intuitive strategy, etc.). However, the somewhat excessive assertion of this idea may suggest that all small firms adopt a specific management method, with the result that management specificity becomes a universal principle. If we allow that small business management can be specific, we must also allow the corollary of this statement, namely the possibility of denaturing (loss of specificity). In other words, a small-sized firm does not necessarily have to adhere to the classical management method. The author of this paper advocate a contingency approach to small business managerial specificity that would allow for the definition of a validity framework for the thesis of small business managerial specificity."
Courpasson David,Dany,01/10/2003,anglais,Indifference or Obedience? Business Firms as democratic hybrids,"To the perennial question of why and how people obey, organizational and political theories usually offer a restricted vision mainly based on interpersonal power processes and organizational control mechanisms. Although such theories are useful, the recent evolution of business organizations toward post-bureaucratic models means they must be combined with another dimension that we call 'moral obedience'. In this article, we suggest that morality is developing in managerial strategies as business contexts become more and more fragile, uncertain and threatened. We argue that this 'moral movement' may be pervasive in hybrid political regimes of governance combining democratic and bureaucratic aspects. The purpose of business leaders is to create loosened communities where people should feel a sense of duty and where, at the same time, a sense of being unique and competitive should remain strongly embedded in individual rationales."
Cova Bernard,Salle,01/09/2003,anglais,When IMP-Don Quixote Tilts his Lance Against the Kotlerian Windmills,"Three decades ago a number of researchers interested in industrial markets were struck by the fact that the prevailing view in BtoC marketing literature was of a world that didn't tally with their own experience and empirical observations. It just wasn't so. As a consequence, since its very first papers, the IMP Group broke with BtoC marketing and its traditional pillars. Thirty years after, it appears that in the IMP community, the representation of BtoC marketing still relies on these pillars. However, this representation of BtoC marketing tends to be outdated. Why the IMP community still relies on the old kotlerian stuff? In order to answer this question, we will use contributions made in the sociology of sciences, especially the works if Bruno Latour. As for any social grouping, the IMP community needs rituals to assert and reassert its existence and the adherence of its members. If the ritual vision of BtoC marketing adds consistency to the life of many members of the IMP community, we wonder if it does not lead to scientific limitation. This limitation does not allow them to take into consideration some interesting post-kotlerian BtoC contributions."
Crespin-Mazet Florence,Salle,01/09/2003,anglais,Developing cooperation in discontinuous supplier/customer relationships,"The aim of this paper is to identify mechanisms at play in the development of cooperation in industries characterized by a high level of purchase discontinuity. The paper concentrates on the construction industry.<br /><br /> In the construction industry adversarial relationships between actors (customers, contractors, subcontractors, suppliers,..) are usually the rule on specific projects such as real estate projects, construction of plants,… Several factors favor this kind of opportunistic behavior: the existing purchasing procedures based on competitive tendering, the industry fragmentation, the uniqueness of construction as a product, the distinction between design and execution, and the specific role of consultants….The crisis that this industry went through in the 90s’ led to huge competition between actors which in turn led to increased opportunism. This generated negative consequences such as difficulties for the main contractor to foresee the profitability on a given project, frequent cost and schedule overruns, confrontation and claims. Faced with these problems important changes occurred in the French construction industry at the end of the 90s’. Main contractors attempted to implement new modes of relationships with customers.<br /><br /> This paper is based on a case study. It analyzes the evolution of a relationship between a main contractor (SBP) and two subsidiaries (DRESS and CLOTH) of the same customer group over a 9 years period. During this period, the main contractor changes its offering (including more pre-sale services, consultancy and feasibility studies when defining and designing the project) and the way to involve the customer in the management of the project (similar to the way traditional industry such as the automotive manages project with suppliers). The objective is to interact with each customer as soon as a project emerges in the customer organization. This anticipative approach aims at allowing the contractor to limit (or to avoid) the scope of the call for tender (highly uncertain), to bring more value to the customer and to have a better predictability on each project profitability.<br /><br /> The empirical study focuses on 7 projects (warehouse) with DRESS and CLOTH (SPB has been awarded 5 projects). Projects after projects the s/c relationship moves from an arm’s length approach (call for tender and lowest price bid, distinction between design phase and execution phase), to a cooperative and partnerial approach (no distinction between design phase and execution phase which are managed by the same company in relation with the customer). As a consequence of these changes, the nature of the relationships between the main contractor and the subcontractors and suppliers also evolve and become more cooperative. Because actors are involved in several relationships, the more connections an actor has, the greater its learning opportunities. Taking a Market as Network perspective, we suggest 4 elements explaining the learning process: the individual project, the succession of projects in a given relationship (multi project perspective), the experience transferred between two interconnected relationships (DRESS and CLOTH are two subsidiaries of the same group), the developments generated on several projects in other s/c relationships."
Durand Rodolphe,,01/09/2003,anglais,Predicting a firm's forecasting ability,"Recent research shows that forecasting ability is an organizational distinctive competence. We propose and test a model accounting for interfirm differences in forecasting ability. After controlling for reciprocal effects, we find that two principal firm-level factors (i.e., organizational illusion of control and organizational attention) influence both bias and magnitude of errors in estimates. High organizational illusion of control increases positive forecast bias. As for organizational attention, higher relative investments in market information appear to reduce positive forecast bias and magnitude of errors; they also moderate forecast bias due to illusion of control. Finally, higher relative investments in employee capability increase both negative forecast bias and, unexpectedly, magnitude of errors for the majority of observed cases."

Our findings, albeit derived from an early stage of our ongoing field research and more exploratory than normative at this point, indicate that at least on the French side, there are attitudes and perceptions that are less positive towards entrepreneurship and its impact, as well as more cynical towards situational and institutional factors that could provide a supportive environment for entrepreneurial ventures or act as impediments to its growth.

In this paper we report on a study designed to examine the impact IT is having on business relationships in two different countries, the United Kingdom and France. The results show that the penetration of IT is greater in France than the UK despite greater investment in the UK (www.eto.org.uk 2002). However, generally, British suppliers are more frequent users and believe IT to be more useful than do their French counterparts. Both French and British buyers are beginning to feel the effects of IT impacting their relationships as they feel there is a reduction in the need for visits."

While the 'new career literature' puts forward the figure of an individual free to invent his/her career (the 'free actor model'), this article shows that the changes purported to affect careers are less radical than they seem. Despite a weakening of environments, discriminating career mechanisms are still imposed on cadres, at least in France. Because individuals do not always have the means or the will to escape those mechanisms, 'external clues' continue to mark careers more than the new career literature supposes. To account for the realities observed in France, this paper proposes a specific view on careers, which highlights why career rules still exist in the country."

While most depictions of post-merger dynamics are limited to anecdotes and retrospective reflections, the team of researchers - from business schools in the four countries represented in the merger - capture events as they unfold, illustrating how organizational reality is both constructed and reconstructed over time. Overall, the volume is an insightful blend of theory and practice, methodological rigor and organizational relevance, and problem analysis and practitioner guidance. It will be of invaluable assistance for anyone contemplating undertaking or researching a cross-border merger. Anthony F. Buono, Professor of Management and Sociology, Bentley College, author of The Human Side of Mergers and Acquisitions This book is a fascinating read for both academics and practitioners. Based on an in-depth ethnographic study of a four-country pan-Nordic merger, the authors provide illuminating insights on the socio-cultural dynamics that transpire during post-merger integration.

There remains little knowledge of how the 'irrational' features of post-acquisition decision-making may impede organizational integration. This study attempts to bridge that gap by examining post-acquisition decision-making from a sensemaking perspective. The paper presents an in-depth analysis of a merger between a large Finnish furniture manufacturer and three smaller Swedish furniture companies. By focusing on the sensemaking processes surrounding integration issues, we uncover four interrelated tendencies that illuminate why the frequent problem of slow progress during post-acquisition integration occurs: inherent ambiguity concerning integration issues; cultural confusion in social interaction and communication; organizational hypocrisy in integration decision-making; and the politicization of integration issues."

The analysis leads to suggestions that: 1. The emergency of improvisation depends on critical thresholds beyond which certain conditions favoring improvisation become conditions hindering improvisation. 2. The involvement of several groups with strong professional identities leads the actors to rely on their identities and to repeat the roles they have learned. 3. The combination of an absence of interaction among the group, and of maintenance of strong intra-group modes of interactions, hinders the process of collective sensemaking that is necessary to improvise"

First, while accepting the definition of organizational identity as “central” and “distinctive”, some identity scholars contest the view that organizational identity should be “enduring”, and suggest that the framing of identity should integrate political struggles and hardly noticed power and political aspects in the identity arena. Second, other identity scholars recognize that identities operate across multiple levels of abstraction and advocate for models that incorporate the multi-level nature of identity.<br> This paper confronts these two issues. We argue that nested and crosscutting identities influence differently an organizational unit’s change of identity. We develop a set of hypotheses relating higher-order nested identities, lower-order nested identities, and inclusive and exclusive crosscutting identities, to identity changes at the focal level. The privileged site of observation is the entire population of French elite restaurants between 1968 and 1997. We use a time series analysis methodology based on Cox regression with repeated measures and time-varying covariates to a remplacer, and eventually support, the hypotheses."

In this paper, we build bridges across levels of analysis in strategic alliance, i.e. inter-organizational, inter-group and inter-individual, and formalize the implications of these interactions for the evolutionary path of an alliance.<br> We model the alliance cooperation at three levels. Relational quality measures the quality of the cooperation at the inter-organizational level. Inter-individual trust between top managers and/or alliance founders best captures the quality of top managers’ inter-individual relationships. Drawing on social identity theory, we contend that factionalism and inter-group behaviours are likely to emerge among alliance front-line and managers. Then, we study interactions between levels. We define the unfavourable conditions under which inter-group factionalist feelings ruin the relational quality and the inter-individual trust, and the more favourable conditions under which relational quality and inter-individual trust play against inter-group factionalist feelings.<br> This socialized, multi-level view of cooperation in strategic alliances provides a holistic understanding of the forces that drive or impede the development of cooperation in strategic alliances. It recognizes and distinguishes the understated influences of alliance founders and alliance front-line and middle managers, and rejuvenates the explanation of under-performance in strategic alliances , a critical issue shared by both academics and practitioners in the field."
Evans Daniel,Servais,01/12/2002,anglais,Support measures for entrepreneurs in europe : Support measures for entrepreneurs in europe,"Within the scope of the European Union, this paper addresses two concerns about support measures for entrepreneurs : 1) concerns about the diversity of measures and structures among the various member states ; 2) concerns about the complexity of measures and structures in each national context. Support measures for entrepreneurs in various member states apparently constitute a heterogeneous panel. A detailed analysis nevertheless shows trends that could lead to a European convergence, and, perhaps, build a European model of entrepreneurial support. This paper tries to provide an understanding of the mechanisms that shape the evolution of support systems. This study attempts to provide an objective representation of the different support measures that exist in Europe as well as a description of the relevant environmental context, providing the groundwork for future normative analysis and benchmarking for evaluation. Using descriptive data recently collected by the DG XXIII, a descriptive analysis of the different support measures in Europe is presented. With an understanding of the framework in Europe established, four countries are presented in greater detail (France, UK, Italy and Germany). Finally, we provide some insights into possible avenues for further research and discussion."

Second, our commentaries suggest that philosophy should be employed for opening discussions and perspectives rather than as an instrument for conviction."
Autier Fabienne,Picq,01/07/2002,anglais,Video games companies: a progressive uncoupling of art and business,"This paper reports the paradoxical results of an empirical study conducted from January to June 2001 in 20 French video games companies. The objective of this empirical study was to observe how video games companies structure themselves and manage their human resources in order to organize the difficult coupling of art and business. The paradox lies in the latter development stages of these companies : as they grow, these companies tend to shift toward a much more rational and classical type of management system that goes along with a radical uncoupling of the two activities : often, the creative part of the business is set apart even sold out. As if creative activities and creative people couldn’t get along with the business logic.<br> These observations are in total contradiction with the Resource Based View of the firm (Barney, 1986 and 1991 ; Wright & McMahan, 1992 ; Galunic et Anderson, 2000) which states that Human Resources are all the more crucial for a given firm as they are specific, non imitable and socially complex (Coff ,1997).

The drive for speed, efficiency and profit does not lead de facto – to the desire for “an enjoyable life with and for others in fair institutions” (Ricœur, 1990:202).<br> What can we answer, in such perspective, to the arguments of managers whose legitimacy, according to phenomenology, is built upon a scientific rationality inherited from Galileo ? Principally following the path opened by Husserl, Merleau Ponty and M. Henry, I will argue that, as human science or social science researchers, we have the possibility to show how the exercise of rationality can be referred to the exercise of reason. This requires that I precise the understanding of reason and of rationality and that I enlighten their articulation . I will then use a field study to show how, in deliberation, rationality can be referred to reason; and how the pursuit of an efficient organization can be referred to the pursuit of an “enjoyable life with and for others in fair institutions” (Ricœur, 1990:202)."

We argue that domain expansion raises three important research questions: 1) the factors that, lead legitimating agencies to expand their domain; 2) the need to maintain legitimacy among existing constituents; and 3) the establishment of legitimacy in the new domain. We use the internationalization of the AACSB to develop propositions relevant to these three research issues. Quality concerns, process vs. content strategy, institutional entrepreneurship are the main factors that impact the legitimation of legitimating agencies."

We argue that this belief over-simplifies the complexity of exchanges that occur among the family firm's decision agents, and does not conform to reality. We develop an alternative agency view of family firm governance that accounts for agency problems that are understated in extant agency models. These problems are rooted in the firm's ownership structure, as well as the altruistic relationships that exist between the firm's decision agents. We conclude with four propositions that address the competitive implications of this alternative view."

Process and product innovations are formalized as the subject matter of the contract, which is observable at no cost by downstream firms, together with local conditions. The latter are unknown by the upstream firm. Anti-complementarities in network co-ordination costs are demonstrated to be necessary and sufficient for the franchisor to obtain strictly positive profits. Upstream profitability is found to decline in favour of franchised firms when the content of the contract is decreasingly proprietary, when local cost or demand conditions harmonize and when co-ordination costs fall.

We address this question in a case study of the process that leads to a strategic alliance between French and Japanese auto-makers Renault and Nissan - two organizations with no prior basis for a core of cooperative behavior to exist. Analyzed in the spirit of theory development, the case study turns on inter-individual processes and time. The data lead us to a gift-theoretical interpretation. Building upon the fundamental anthropological idea of gift / contra-gift (Mauss, 1925/1990) to describe cooperative behaviors between unacquainted individuals, we articulate how different types of gifts and the pace of reciprocal giving are employed to generate cooperative behavior over time. Critically for practical relevance and theoretical scope, the gift-theoretical approach developed does not impose linearity: the generation of cooperative behavior can be routinized, escalated, or even reversed. To the literature on cooperation in inter-organizational relationships, we offer an interpretative framework for further theoretical elaboration and empirical testing.

We propose and a remplacer a model accounting for interfirm differences in forecasting ability. After controlling for reciprocal effects, we find that two principal firm-level factors (i.e., organizational illusion of control and organizational attention) contribute to both negative and positive errors in estimates. A high organizational illusion of control enhances organizational optimism (ex post positive errors) and reduces organizational pessimism (ex post negative errors). As for organizational attention, higher relative investments in market information appear to reduce the magnitude of both types of errors. Also, while improving a firm’s relative ability to interpret this information through education expenditures reduces organizational optimism, it unexpectedly increases organizational pessimism. Finally, organizational attention moderates optimistic biases due to illusion of control."

We rely on Henri Bergson's ontology of creative evolution so as to build a `quad-motor' theory explaining the process of development in organizations and to formulate propositions on the relationships between organizational development and the lay ontology of organizational members. Then we illustrate the links between philosophy and practice, and show how the analysis of a narrative by a practitioner (Michel Barthod, Chief Executive of Salomon, a high-growth company, in the 1980s) can elicit his lay ontology, thus making possible future empirical corroborations of the above propositions. This narrative is in line with Bergson's ontology of creative (dialectical) evolution, and also contains the concepts of an integrative framework explaining organizational development. In the third section, inspired by the philosopher, Henri Bergson, and by the practitioner, Michel Barthod, we build such a framework in which becoming and relating are two central intertwined concepts."

From a Corporate Strategy perspective, this association appears somewhat hazardous since it reinforces 1) the risk of strategic misalignment and 2) the risk of competitive advantage erosion. In effect, corporations cannot rely on personal initiative without increasing the autonomy of individuals and the risk that their personal projects might diverge significantly from key strategic alignments. Furthermore, by doing so, corporations favor the progressive transformation of certain employees into highly valuable and marketable entrepreneurs, thus reducing the level of embeddedness of their most valuable human resources and, consequently, the sustainability of their competitive advantage.

Using a form of meta-analysis known as a case survey design, which combines the ideographic richness of case studies with the statistical generalizability of larger samples, and a sample consisting of 50 mergers and acquisitions (23 US domestic, 15 Swedish domestic and 12 Swedish cross-border), we found that acculturation is best achieved when the buying firms rely on social controls. That is, by participating in such activities as introduction programs, training, cross-visits, retreats, celebrations and similar socialization rituals, employees will create, of their own volition, a joint organizational culture regardless of expectations of synergies, the relative organization size and differences in nationalities and cultures. A post hoc analysis of a proposed integration control typology further suggests that social controls also indirectly influence acculturation by acting in concert with formal integrative efforts."

In this paper we take such bearings, using data derived from a detailed qualitative, ethnographic enquiry into the experience of project management. Project managers from France speak authentically about the experience of being a project manager. From this data we construct the contours more sharply. Rather than being a harbinger of an autonomous and more democratic future, free from extant bureaucratic organization controls, we find that project management has distinct modalities of control that we outline in the paper: behavioural, calculative, organizational, professional and corporate. Indeed, rather than foreshadowing a future transformational form, we find traces of a much older design: that of Tocqueville."

Using a Delphi study of experts from around the world, the possible uses of the Internet as well as criteria for successful implementation are presented. Three critical success factors for providing online services are identified. First, an effective use of online resources requires that the inherent strengths of the Internet be exploited. Using online tools when they are perceived to be a 'second-best' mode of communication is inefficient and can be counterproductive. Second, personal contact is still very important and can complement online services. Third, successful online services require an effective Internet site and program management. The study also shows that the specific nature of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurs must be carefully considered when developing online services. The entrepreneur is more concerned about his/her problems and is less concerned with the problems of others. However, he or she is willing to participate in a small learning network if the benefits go beyond that of just learning together. Similarly, online training for entrepreneurs should be complemented by a face-to-face component. An efficient/effective pure online training program for entrepreneurs would be very difficult if not impossible to develop and implement."

Cova Bernard,Crespin-Mazet Salle,01/09/2001,anglais,Ambiguity in choice of entry modes in project marketing,"Projects, such as construction projects, are complex transactions which require suppliers to group their competencies into a consortium of firms in order to formulate an offer meeting customer’s specifications. This gives rise for the project suppliers to a wide range of options by which to enter the project pyramid ranging from prime contractor to subcontractors roles. As such, the project entry mode can be directly related to the bidding strategy. But, at the same time, the selection of the mode of entry on a specific project goes beyond this single bidding strategy. This decision is encapsulated into more long-term marketing priorities such as the development of inter-organisational relationships and the buiding up of a position in a specific market.<br /<<br /> This paper follows the chronological study of a cement plant project (CP4) in Vietnam for a customer called CVT. The focus is on the intercction between two potential actors of the project supply consortium: a French engineering firm (Petech) willing to act as prime contractor and a posssible supplier for the electrical lot which is a French industrial company (Grinlec). The paper highlights the three conflicting logics that are at play between the actors of the consortium: (1)the project perspective, (2)the relational perspective between actors and (3)the market perspective. The paper highlights the fact that, for a given actor of the supply side, the choice of project entry mode in the consortium is the result of its own combination of these three logics."

Faÿ Eric,,01/06/2001,anglais,"The destructive impact of derision"" in the hyper-rational organization""","It’s better to lose one’s hat than one’s head.” The humour of this statement, uttered in the context of the French revolution (cf Leconte’s film Ridicule), helps the subject come to terms with the pain of losing an object; above all, it helps them put things in perspective and focus on what is essential – the joy of being alive. The witticism stems from the unconscious life drive, and makes a distinction between the living subject and its objects. Conversely, derision causes one to laugh not at the situation but at the subject. It puts the subject in the forefront, and then subsequently negates it: it stems from the unconscious death drive. Thus from a psychoanalytical perspective, and in the light of the unconscious, Denis Vasse describes the liberating nature of joy and the destructive nature of derision on the human subject in “Derision and Joy” (1999). What I propose to do now is to use Denis Vasse’s work as a basis for a discussion, from a psychoanalytical standpoint – on the destructive effects on the human subject of certain human resources management techniques (assessments, quality standardization, audits, etc) which abuse the subject’s speech. By drawing a comparison between the structural similarities of these techniques and derision – for both consist in pushing the subject to the forefront and subsequently negating it –. I will show how these management techniques cause the human subject to suffer, by examining the clinical work of Denis Vasse[2]. However, I do not aim to restrict myself to using derision to identify the destructive nature of certain management techniques: I wish to use this standpoint to reintroduce the subject (as an end and not a means) into the question of productivity and competitiveness, and thus envisage a way of working which consists in finding the means to structure organizations without abusing the human subjects within them. In order to do this, it will be necessary to take into account human subjectivity as defined by psychoanalysis in the light of the unconscious - that is to say, to find an appropriate way to take the subject’s word into consideration. However, it seems to me to be increasingly difficult to take the subject’s word into consideration in hyper-rational organizations, where exchanges between subjects are likened – according to the views of N.Wiener[3] and Herbert Simon[4] – to information processing. The language at play here is not only abstract (cf. my presentation last year on the blockage to/repression of “ressenti”), but anonymous and impersonal. This rational language helps the organization run smoothly, but, as Lacan has already observed, does not help the Subject speech: “The more functional language becomes, the more unsuited it is for speech…” (1966:180). “The wall of language comes into conflict with speech.” (1966:162). Herein lies the very essence of the problem I would like to talk to you about today. According to Denis Vasse, the process of derision stems precisely from this impersonal, operative language: “The violence of derision worms its way into the child’s body in the form of words which say nothing because they are part of a discourse which in reality no one says to anyone.” (1999:99). “It is possible to find a language which is functionally extremely effective in the domain of the imaginary but which doesn’t actually say anything.” (1999:18). But what happens to the subject exposed to such language?"""

We then test these predictions using longitudinal data specified at the product-market level, a unit of analysis that is less influenced by aggregation bias than are industry, firm, and even line-of-business level data. Our findings demonstrate how organizational ecology, when coupled with strategic management and industrial organization economic theories, can enrich our understanding of horizontal mergers."

Millier Paul,Palmer,01/03/2001,anglais,Turning innovation into profit,"Pour le management du processus de développement de produits nouveaux, le recours à un découpage en étapes types est généralement accepté. Ce découpage prend pour base qu'il est possible de découper le développement du projet en une série d'étapes de décision pré définies dans le but d'équilibrer et d'arbitrer entre le risque qui est pris et le retour espéré. Cette utilisation s'appuie sur plusieurs hypothèses. Tout d'abord que le produit peut être défini à l'avance à partir de ses caractéristiques et des bénéfices client qu'il apporte; ensuite que le marché est identifiable dans cet article, les auteurs décrivent une méthode pour prendre les décisions quand ces deux hypothèses ne sont pas remplies."
Roux-dufort Christophe,Vidaillet,01/03/2001,anglais,From normalization to improvisation in crisis Management: a case study,"Il existe deux approches pour décrire le comportement et le processus de décision des managers en situation de crise. D’une part, plusieurs recherches attestent que les managers confrontés à une crise ont tendance à utiliser des cadres de références et des normes familiers pour gérer la crise. Ils se reposent ainsi sur des routines existantes pour appréhender la crise et la gérer. Nous qualifions ce comportement de normalisation. D’autre part d’autres auteurs suggèrent que l’improvisation et le bricolage peuvent être des alternatives pour échapper aux tourments de la crise. Ils partent de l’idée que la nature inattendue, non planifiée et chaotique de la crise procure aux individus l’opportunité de puiser dans des registres que jusqu’alors ils ignoraient et d’utiliser les ressources à disposition pour concevoir des plans ad hoc propres à contrôler la situation en cours. En utilisant l’étude de cas du nuage toxique de Nantes (France, 1987) qui se solda par l’évacuation de 40000 personnes, cet article contribue premièrement à comprendre pourquoi les individus persistent à se reposer sur des schémas et des cadres d’action bien définis alors que les crises sont inhabituelles et peu comparables avec des expériences ou des savoirs préalables, deuxièmement à explorer jusqu’à quel point les comportements et les décisions normalisés empêchent l’émergence de comportements improvisés et troisièmement à examiner les conditions dans lesquelles la normalisation et l’improvisation ont le plus de chance d’apparaître en situation de crise. <br> <br>"
Autier Fabienne,,01/01/2001,anglais,Bureaucracy vs Adhocracy: a Case of Overdramatisation,"It has been argued that bureaucratic management systems were definitely non effective if organizations were to innovate. As an alternative it has been argued that only non-bureaucratic type of management systems i.e “organic” or “adhocratic” management systems were conducive to innovation. In this article, a case study of a highly innovative firm suggests that the alternative is not as straightforward as it may seem. The study investigates a conceptual and practical asymmetry between the two ideal-types. The study’s findings identify a major blind spot of the supposedly non-bureaucratic management systems : namely, regulation. This leads us to argue that Adhocratic management systems are not a self-standing alternative to Bureaucratic management systems, but rather a variation of the latter. Such a variation tends to generate a “paradoxical management system”."
CALORI Roland,Baden-fuller HUNT,01/01/2001,anglais,Managing change at Novotel: back to the future,"Novotel is one of the world’s major hotel chains, occupying a leading place in Europe and with locations globally. We interpret Novotel’s change management programme in the 1990s in three parts. First, we summarise the actions that managers took in terms of strategy and organisation. Second, we consider the sequence and timing of events, and how this resulted in rapid transformation in an organisation employing more than 30,000 people. Third, we emphasise the dialectical nature of the change processes: an element often ignored in the literature that likes to see things as an either–or rather than a both. We observed both deliberation and experimentation; both integration and differentiation. We also observed both preservation and transformation, as noted in our sub-title ‘Back to the Future’. Finally, we wrap up with a discussion explaining how our story can add to better thinking about change. We suggest that we can shed new light on some old debates and provide tangible guides for action. qc 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd."
Durand Rodolphe,COEURDEROY,01/01/2001,anglais,"Age, order of entry, srategic orientation and organization performance","This paper proposes an empirical test of several hypotheses linking age, order of entry, and strategic orientations to a firm’s performance. Three strategies are defined: cost-leadership strategy, innovative differentiation, and marketing differentiation. The aim is to show that the impact on performance of both age and each of the three strategic orientations may differ according to a firm’s order of entry into an industry. Following Lieberman and Montgomery’s (1998) evaluation of their major contribution on first mover advantage, we emphasize three points. First, we develop and test hypotheses related to early and late followers’ strategic orientations, broadening the scope of traditional studies on pioneers. Second, the model combines the dimensions of a firm’s age, order of entry, and strategic orientations, as well as industry conditions (stage of the industry, environmental unpredictability, and technology diffusion), to establish a contingent model of performance analysis. Finally, the empirical study deals chiefly with organizational performance and not market share, which is considered a typical advantage accruing to pioneers. In addition, the scope of the study (582 French manufacturing firms) provides the means to fill a void in empirical studies because it is a broad cross-sectional test on non-U.S. data. The firms are mainly private, small to medium-sized, and single or dominant business firms. Therefore, our assumptions must be understood as particularly applicable to this type of firm. The results reveal important lessons for practitioners. First, we did not find a first-mover advantage in terms of organizational performance. In addition, pioneers’ organizational performance is enhanced by the cost leader strategy—contrary to our assumption emphasizing innovative differentiation for these firms. Second, early followers’ performance benefits from innovative differentiation and marketing differentiation. Finally, late entrants developing a cost leader strategy have a significantly higher performance. All groups considered, late followers are the firms most sensitive to environmental uncertainty and age effects Our study clarifies the impact of a firm’s age and strategic orientations on its performance depending on the firm’s order of entry. The implications of these results are particularly relevant for practitioners and entrepreneurs. First, a cost leadership strategy seems to be a guarantee for a pioneer to increase its organizational performance. New ventures should therefore take into consideration the fact that newness and innovative differentiation might not be the best strategic orientations for high performance in the long run. Second, as a second mover, however, developing a superior product and being able to market it efficiently appear to be the enhancing factors of firm performance. Third, for both pioneers and early followers, age does not significantly reduce their performance. However, the longer a firm waits before entering, the greater is the negative effect of age on its performance. This is due to the difficulty of resisting competitive erosion, because pioneers and early followers drive the changes in the industry. The identification of these effects should help managers and stakeholders to make more effective entry decisions to sustain a firm’s advantage, leading to better performance and higher probability of survival."
Durand Rodolphe,,01/01/2001,anglais,Firm Selection: an Integrative Perspective,"This paper highlights the variable intensity of selection pressure on firms. Failing to include a theory of selection pressure in assessing a firm's performance can lead to ambiguous or incomplete judgements on the rationales of the firm's success. Building on previous threads of literature (population ecology, evolutionary economics, and the dynamic resource-based view of the firn), this paper paves the way for a unified theory of selection through seven research propositions. Emphasis is placed on the fact that managers can use the determinants of selection strategically, either to avoid the direct pressure of selection or to pass it on competitors."

Entrepreneurs are meeting our economic needs through the creation of thousands of new businesses each year. This study sought to adopt a new research approach in that it focused on people who had the intention of starting a business and investigated both those who had founded and those who abandoned their new venture. While the environment surrounding the entrepreneur cannot be discounted, the findins suggest that the personality of the entrepreneur play a key role in the start-up process but must be considered within its context. Those nascent entrepreneurs who proceeded to start-up were found to habe a strong desire to create combined with the ability to acquire suitable labor support. Negative influences were found to be a fear of failure, absence of help and inability to find a location of choice for the business."

CALORI Roland,,01/12/2000,anglais,Organizational development and the ontology of creative dialectical evolution,"Ce papier invite les chercheurs en théorie des organisations à un double étirement, vers la philosophie et vers les “théories ordinaires” des praticiens. Nous nous appuyons sur l’ontologie de l’évolution créatrice, offerte par Henri Bergson (1907-1986) afin de (1ère partie) construire une théorie « quadri-moteur » du processus de développement organisationnel, et (2ème partie) formuler des propositions sur les relations entre le développement de l’organisation et l’ontologie « ordinaire » de ses membres. Puis nous montrons comment l’analyse d’un récit par un praticien (Michel Barthod, Directeur Général de Salomon, entreprise en forte croissance dans les années quatre-vingt) révèle son ontologie « ordinaire », ce qui permet d’envisager des corroborations futures des propositions. Ce récit est très cohérent avec l’ontologie de l’évolution créatrice (dialectique) et il contient plusieurs concepts qui permettent de construire un cadre de référence expliquant le développement organisationnel. Dans la troisième partie, inspirés par le philosophe Henri Bergson et par le praticien Michel Barthod, nous proposons un tel cadre de référence dans lequel le « devenir » et le « relier » sont deux concepts fondamentaux, entrelacés dans un mouvement spiralé. <br> <br>"

Gomez Pierre-Yves,JONES,01/11/2000,anglais,Crossroads - Conventions,"To describe human action as purely the product of rational calculation leaves unanswered the question of how human beings can act in the absence of any structure for calculating the likely outcome of their actions. If the answer is that they cannot, how can any such structure be stable and comprehensive enough to enable action without becoming either inert or deterministic?In this paper, we seek to understand how free will and social context can interact to produce both structure and action. This is accomplished through the development of a framework based on the notion ofconvention. Organizations, in this view, are grounded in effort conventions"" of what constitutes ""normal"" effort at work, that structure the action of those who work within the organization, and in turn reinforce these structures. We show how humans can calculate within a context of socially constructed beliefs, and how these beliefs can evolve, provided that they remain essentially nonjustified and beyond the reach of rational calculation. It is this mix of rational calculation and nonrational beliefs that form the core of our model.We begin by defining the nature of a convention and its properties. We then describe the evolutionary dynamics of conventions, and show that conventions exist in competition with other conventions and evolve over time. Our model of convention is then linked to other notions, advanced in the managerial literature, which point to a kind of 'deep structure' that lies at the heart of organizations. We conclude by outlining how this notion can shed new light on the analysis of organizations."""

Ce paradoxe est au coeur des discussions que nourrisent les auteurs sur la fiabilité organisationnelle. Dans cet article nous montrons que les courants de recherche traditionnels sur la fiabilité organisationnelle - la théorie des accidents normaux, l'école des organisations de haute fiabilité et la gestion des crises - en concentrant leur analyse au niveau organisationnel ont résolu ce paradoxe de façon superficielle . Nous proposons qu'une analyse au niveau du comportement des groupes soit entreprise pour compléter les théories existantes.

Cova Bernard,Dontenwill Salle,01/09/2000,anglais,A network approach to the broadening of the offering,"Research concerning the marketing of industrial products highlights the importance of the services “surrounding” the product as sources of competitive advantage. Several attempts at classification have been put forward to characterise these services. Mathieu (1999) distinguishes those services which support the supplier’s product (SSP) and those which support client’s action (SSC) in relation to the supplier’s product. Following our work on specific cases, we have seen that other types of services do exist: client services with no direct link to the supplier’s products but whose aim is to help the client develop activity and market position, and services supporting the client’s network (SSN). This final type of service is specific to project marketing and system selling. At the end of this paper we shall underline some managerial repercussions created by such service offers."
Gomez Pierre-Yves,Volery,01/08/2000,anglais,How do Organizations come into Existence?,"This paper shows that existing theoretical frameworks provide a limited explanation to theentrepreneurial process. The entrepreneur appears as an individual who merely transformsuncertainty into risk, thus reducing the entrepreneurial process to rational economic reasoning. Anew perspective of organization emergence drawing on evolutionary theory is therefore suggested.The entrepreneurial process is characterized by a paradox rooted in the discontinuity implied bythe birth of a new organization. The entrepreneur creates this discontinuity by imagining a businessscenario that does not yet exist for other economic actors. The fundamental role of theentrepreneur consists of bridging the space-time gap that exists from his or her own perspectiveand the perspective of the resource holders which are necessary to rally in order to launch thebusiness venture. Overall, the framework presented suggests that organizations come intoexistence according to a genetic process which needs to be understood on its own"
CALORI Roland,Atamer Nunes,01/06/2000,anglais,International competition in mixed industries,"The collective knowledge of practitioners is useful for theory building. One of the roles of researchers is to tap practitioners' knowledge, analyse it and integrate it into a collective knowledge base (a process similar to the design of expert systems). This paper analyses the collective knowledge of practitioners in four mixed industries: cables and wires, chocolate and sugar confectionery, paint, and footwear, and compares their collective espoused theory of the dynamics of international competition to mainstream economic and strategic theories. Several salient concepts are discussed: the formation of regional competitive territories, the dual effect of marketing intensity, the in¯uence of demand factors (international customers and high-growth market), and the role of strategic innovators across borders. These concepts deviate from mainstream theories of internationalisation and suggest new theoretical developments. Also the framework derived from this collective knowledge base can return to managers and be used for crafting international strategies."
Faÿ Eric,,01/06/2000,anglais,Emotion and “ressenti” in the hyper-modern information processing organization,"This paper represents the culmination of a transformation in my own understanding of the relationship between information and emotion in modern organizations. In this paper, I demonstrate that the recent focus and interest in management toward emotions in organizations and towards emotional intelligence are likely to remain as no more than a ‘fashion’ if we do not clearly identify why emotions were irrelevant in management science and management practices till now. My answer and my focus in this paper are on the ways in which the scientific model of information-processing in the hyper-modern organization confuses speech with information, rationality with reason, power with programming, and feeling with stimulus. As a result, the subject is separated from his or her own body and emotion or feeling, because these have no place and no value within the model. Using the French term ressenti, I suggest that a psychoanalytic approach to organisational research and consultancy can act as a counterbalance to the dominant model. The concept of ressenti, as developed by Denis Vasse and Françoise Dolto from the work of Lacan, describes ‘full speech’; that is, where the feeling and talking body and the right word emerge together, often using the path of metaphor. In such moments, the subject’s truth appears to be different from scientific truth and managerial rationality. On the basis of this understanding, we have to ask ourselves: How can emotion find a place in hyper-modern organizations? Does emotion create unmanageable disorder? How is it possible to reconcile these two perspectives in the business context? I shall illustrate these themes with examples from a research project in a multi-national firm."

Millier Paul,Palmer,01/05/2000,anglais,"Nuts, Bolts and Magnetrons","Industrial or business-to-business marketing places very specific demands on those responsible for it. Yet all too often the strengths of these managers are technical, founded on expertise and product knowledge. There is seldom any formal understanding of marketing principles and the business benefits they can bring. In such conditions perspectives are narrowed, opportunities are missed, and marketing remains a functional support activity rather than a strategic resource. Building on a basis of recent Cranfield research and their own extensive work with experienced practising managers, Paul Millier and Roger Palmer have devised the perfect solution. A complete reference and toolkit for managers in the field, Nuts, Bolts and Magnetrons showcases a wealth of examples from European industry, and provides the information and guidance industrial marketers need to develop and prosper. Readers will learn how to be not only functionally efficient, but also effective, by managing relationships within and outside the firm. If you are involved in industrial marketing then you must be properly equipped. Blending insight, information, and inspiration in equal measure, this book offers all you need for success - the Nuts, Bolts and Magnetrons of modern marketing."
Mahérault Loïc,,01/03/2000,anglais,The influence of going public on investment policy: An empirical study of French family-owned businesses,"This article focuses on the lack of capital available to small, private, family-owned businesses or businesses in which the manager and his or her family hold more than 51% of the total number of shares. It claims that being listed might be the best way to overcome this lack of capital. The article starts from the established view that access to financial resources is not easy for small family-owned businesses (Coleman & Carsky, 1999; De Visscher, Aronoff, & Ward 1995; Harvey & Evans 1995). In questioning the generally admitted frontier between investment and financing policies (Modigliani & Miller, 1958, 1963), this empirical work is on the fringe of standard financial theory. The study is carried out on two samples of small French family firms. The first is composed of 46 private companies, the second of 49 listed companies. All companies are SMEs (small and medium-size enterprises) and are nearly the same size. Empirical results are based on two crosssectional analyses (1992, 1993). Linear regressions between investment and financial constraints are presented for the two samples separately. Results are very different, depending on whether the firm is listed. The description of private firms’ investment is consistent with the pecking order theory (Myers & Majluf, 1984) and financial constraints clearly appear. The description of listed family firms is more classical: investment and financing policies seem to be independent. Finally, quoted family-owned businesses do not seem to suffer from lack of capital."

The four industry case studies suggest an empirical classification of innovative international strategies based on four main dimensions: nature of the firm’s competitive advantage, process of internationalization, segment scope, and level of coordination across borders.

Cova Bernard,Salle VINCENT,01/01/2000,anglais,To bid or not to bid: screening the whorcop project,"A major decision for a company selling projects-toorder is to decide whether to bid or not on a specific project. Bidding for a project, usually through a competitive bidding process, involves both a huge expense in preparing the answer to the bid and an important mobilisation of resources that can be damaging for other company businesses. Consequently, the so-called screening of projects or prebid analysis appears to be a strategic procedure of paramount importance. It aims at solving the bid/no bid or go/no go dilemma experienced by the company faced with each project. It constitutes the basis for designing the marketing action of the company on the project in a bidding or solution fashion. In this article, we will explore the case of the Catalu shipyard which screens the Whorcop project and then develops a tactic to win the bid."
Fayolle Alain,,01/01/2000,anglais,Setting up a favourable environmental framework to promote and develop entrepreneurship education,"National situations in teaching entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship education are today quite different. Some countries, for instance the United States or Canada, are diffusing the enterprise culture, and delivering entrepreneurship programs and courses within their educational system for many years. Others are very late in this respect and are probably limited in their progress by environmental factors and framework which could not be well adapted. This consideration seems to be essential. When looking at the French situation, for example, it is obvious that some factors associated with social and culture norms could play a negative role. In order to more precisely assess the impact of environmental factors and their related framework on the development of entrepreneurship education, it could be of interest to start with an international comparison. So, the first part of this paper analyses the results of expert interviews which come from 2 countries (France, USA) and focuses on educational, social and cultural norms. The second part of the paper analyses, in detail the teaching of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship education in France from three perspectives. Finaly, the last part of the paper highlights some particular (influential the French case) and more general outcomes which could be seen as favorable environmental conditions or factors for promoting and developing Entrepreneurship Education."

Therefore, the management of business relationships is today considered as a critical task on which a company's very existence depends . Consequently, allotting limited company resources between several relationships has become a major task for marketers who must decide how to divide and allot time and money for customers and prospective customers . In this renewed context, the portfolio concept for supplier-customer relationships are of a continuous nature and when the boundaries of the customer are easy to delimit . In order to widen the scope of their relevance, we propose to re-embed the supplier-customer relationship into the network of business actors that influences it and to be very careful in defining who is the customer ."
Vaara Eero,,01/01/2000,anglais,Constructions of cultural differences in Post-Merger change processes,"Cultural differences are often used as explanations of organizational problems following mergers. This paper argues that this literature is to a large extent based on a realist epistemology where too little emphasis has been placed on the constructive processes. To partially bridge this gap, this study adopts a sensemaking approach to studying the (re)construction of cultural conceptions in the merger context. The study is based on extensive ethnographic material from eight cases of Finnish-Swedish mergers and acquisitions. The analysis of this material leads to a specification of three concurrent cultural sensemaking processes through which the top decision makers involved in the post-merger integration processes make sense of and enact cultural conceptions. First, this cultural sensemaking involves a search for rational understanding of cultural characteristics and differences. Second, cultural sensemaking also includes more or less suppressed emotional identification with either of the merging sides. Third, cultural sensemaking also involves purposeful manipulation of the cultural conceptions for more or less legitimate purposes. Based on this distinction, this study leads to specific propositions concerning how cultural conceptions are formed in post-merger organizations. Hence, the analysis helps us to understand that cultural conceptions are not only reflections of “real” cultural differences but are also products of complex cognitive, emotional and political processes."

Millier Paul,,01/06/1999,anglais,Marketing the unknown,"Innovations are always exceptional events in company life and they tend to stay in the hands of technicians or design offices - they are peripheral to mainstream business and people do not know how to manage them. In 'Marketing the Unknown', Paul Millier attempts to find new answers to these innovation problems, on the grounds that each problem is unique and that there is not necessarily a known recipe for it or a success story that corresponds. Paul Millier lays down firm principles to guide systematic and constructive plans for the marketing and development of technological innovations. These have been derived from observing a large number of industrial innovation projects over a long period of time - examples of which are used throughout the book to illustrate his argument. He also encourages the reader to think constructively and stimulates the imagination with the intention of enabling the reader to realise that other possible solutions exist."

With the increasing use of subcontractors in disparate locations for many business functions and the continual drive for shorter lead-times, this supply-chain network is a critical factor in business success. Derek WallerÆs new approach to operations management treats operations and the supply chain as an integrated system, highlighting the links between the supply chain and all other parts of the business in both the manufacturing and service sectors. To reflect this, he gives more prominence to key topics such as inventory control, quality, planning and forecasting than many competitive books. A comprehensive and practical text, the first edition has been praised for its fresh approach, lively writing style, use of examples and international emphasis.The current book takes a fully student-centred approach complete with chapter introductions, summaries, boxed examples, questions, exercises and cases. As befits a modern text in operations management, Waller balances the coverage of manufacturing and service sectors and includes up-to-date technological topics.The new edition will be rewritten throughout to incorporate the latest technological advances and business thinking. In addition, the supply chain approach will be more clearly highlighted, along with links to strategy, to provide a more coherent conceptual framework."
LUBATKIN Michael,CALORI Véry VEIGA,01/11/1998,anglais,Managing mergers across borders: a two nation exploration of a nationally bound administrative heritage,"Top managers of British and French firms, which were recently acquired by either British or French firms, were surveyed as to their perceptions of the administrative approach-reflected in integrating mechanisms-used by the acquiring firms to estab- lish headquarters-subsidiary control. Four types of integrative mechanisms were examined: structural, systems, social, and managerial. A multiple analysis of covariance model, coupled with a two-nation (British and French), two-merger type (do- mestic, cross-national) sampling design, found evidence that the administrative approaches used by managers during merger in- tegration from two nations partially reflect their different heri- tages, and that these differences are consistent with national differences and the theoretical perspectives of institutional de- velopment and cross-cultural studies. Our findings, while ex- ploratory, provide insight into the administrative difficulties of managing across borders and help us understand why many cross-national firms continue to use ethnocentric approaches in spite of the incentives for adopting a transnational approach. Moreover, our findings add one more voice to a growing chorus calling for a theory of the firm, as embedded, institutionally, culturally, and historically."
Azimont Frank,Cova Salle,01/09/1998,anglais,Solution Selling and Project Marketing,"On business markets it is possible to observe a double orientation. On the one hand companies dealing with products and services try to combine them in a « solution selling » approach. On the other hand, companies selling projects to order try to create the project through a « creative offering » approach. Consequently, these two orientations converge by integrating a new dimension in their approaches, namely « consultancy » and « expertise » in customer's activities. The core of these approaches is to develop close and « intimate » relationships with customers. This leads us to broaden the scope of these approaches emphasizing the blurring of the boundaries and the collapse of the distinction between industrial marketing, project marketing and even services marketing."

This networking action forms the basis of a proactive approach aiming at anticipating bids and at maximizing the firm's chances of success on on-going projects."
Gomez Pierre-Yves,Bidault DESPRES BUTLER,01/11/1996,anglais,The Drivers of Co-operation between Buyers and Suppliers for Product Innovation,"ESI is defined as a form of vertical cooperation where manufacturers involve suppliers at an early stage in the product development/innovation process, generally at the level of concept and design. Previous research has shown that Western automobiles manufacturers obtained significant benefits by emulating the ESI practices of their Japanese competitors; the bulk of research knowledge is, in fact, located in this domain. This study focused on a group of assembly-based industries outside the automotive setting to determine if the adoption and benefits of ESI are found in other domains as well. Twenty-five companies in three non-automotive industries participated in the research. A model of ESI adoption was developed and tested, and an ESI index created to determine the degree to which this practice was applied. The results reveal, among other things, that the level of ESI practice is strongly related to a higher number of supplier base initiatives, lower product integration, broader supplier scope and a higher proportion of parts purchased. Significant results were also obtained in comparisons between industry sectors and geographic regions (USA, Western Europe and Japan). We suggest that promising directions for future research include broad-based samples across industrial sectors and industry-focused empirical study."
Cova Bernard,Crespin-Mazet,01/09/1996,anglais,Co-construction of the demand,"This paper presents the theoretical groundings of an on-going research on the construction of demand and thus of offer in project business. It is based on a review of constructivist approaches in the social sciences and on the consumer evolution towards co-design of the offer in our postmodern societies. The analysis is applied to an extreme case i.e. the joint construction of a capital-project between the supplier, the client, and other actors of the milieu. The choice of the socio-technical graph approach as research method is justified by the relevance of this method to follow the social construction of technical innovations. The aim of the research is to investigate the possible strategies of co-construction of offer and demand."

Pardo Catherine,Salle,01/09/1995,anglais,Defining Customer Boundaries,"In this paper we focus on the relationships between a supplier and its customers through an analysis of customer portfolio methods. Indeed, several methods of customer portfolio management have been proposed in the literature for fifteen years. These methods present some strong similarities, namely the choice of two distinct dimensions, choice of different criteria qualifying those dimensions, and use of a matrix representation. But, one of the problems when using these methods, remains the choice of the relevant customer unit boundary to be taken into account. In the case of industrial groups with complex decision making process, the definition of the relevant unit of analysis is not obvious.<br /><br /> This complexity makes it difficult to undertake a customer portfolio analysis. Indeed, on which entity (or customer level) must the analysis be carried out ? For instance, organizational complexity often means a geographical multi-location ; in this case which part"" of the customer must we consider to build up the customer portfolio"" ? Is it the central level (e.g. the headquarters) ? Is it the whole set of sites ? Is it only part of these sites ?<br /><br /> Three firm cases are presented. They lead us to highlight that the characteristics of the buying decision process in the customer organization and the characteristics of the supplier organization both influence the delimitation of the customer unit boundary. Finally we make an attempt to include the definition of customer unit boundary within existing customer portfolio methods."""
Pardo Catherine,Salle Spencer,01/03/1995,anglais,The key accountization of the firm,"This article focuses on the adaptation process undergone by a company to manage a particularpart of its customers' portfolio : the key accounts. It is based on an in-depth study of the evolution of a unit dedicated to the management of key accounts in a company belonging to the telecom sector. Data was gathered on a total often interviews with different managers of the key accounts unit using face-to-face interviewing techniques. After describing their theoretical framework grounded on the Interaction Model developed by an European research group (the IMP Group) and the networks perspective, the authors first concentrate on the description of the various stages of the process corresponding to different supplier organizational modes. Then the authors propose a categorization of the possible explanatory factors of this process. Several associated managerial implications are discussed. Particularly, the authors will show that the key accountization process is not uniquely a result of adaptation to the customers but also a process of adaptation to changes occurring at the supplier level or at the environment level. This process appearing more as a muddling through'process than a carefully planned and implemented chain of events. Finally the authors will show that this process sometimes is also creating complexity by its very existence. This is raising the question of the desirable degree of organizational differentiation in key account programs."""
Pardo Catherine,Salle,01/12/1994,anglais,Strategic interplays of an actor in a relationship with a distributor,"In this article we describe the strategic interplay of actors involved in a tripartite relationship (supplier-distributor-end user), which aim at maintaining or modifying each actor's position relative to the other actors in the relationship and in the surrounding network, using both direct and indirect action. In the case of energy distribution in France (electricity and gas), certain specificities have to be taken into account: the electricity supplier's monopolistic position and its obligation to supply the service, and the distribution centers’ mixed vocation (they propose two kinds of energy, gas from Gaz de France and electricity from Electricité de France) and their obligation to distribute both kinds of energy. On the basis of an analysis of ten relationships between the Electricity Production and Transportation Division and Energy Distribution Centers, we show the actors’ search for an optimal distance between the supplier and the intermediary. According to its own resources, the intermediary tries to deal with its own end-user market in an autonomous way or to use resources represented by the supplier and other actors in the connected network. Some managerial implications concerning the management of supplier compulsory relationships with a differentiated approach are suggested."
Cova Bernard,Crespin-Mazet Salle,01/03/1994,anglais,From competitive tendering to strategic marketing,"Based on the analysis of the strategic marketing approaches implemented by four firms selling projects and systems under the rule of competitive tendering, this article advocates that their marketing approaches depart both from mere reactive behaviours and from rigid strategic planning guidelines to projects opportunities. The strategic approach used by these firms can be conceptualized in a ten-stage process divided into two major phases: a general approach independent of a given project opportunity, and a project-specific approach. The general approach can be seen as an anticipatory process both at the technical and cognitive levels leading to the definition, by the supplier firm, of an overall core offering and to the establishment of a portfolio of project opportunities. The project specific approach can be seen as an adaptation process in which the supplier adjusts his/her overall offering according to project specificities."

These ephemeral groups seem to form an ""invisible or hidden network"" behind a project and can freeze it in spite of the agreement of more traditional, 'visible"" decision-makers (such as political actors for example)."""
Courpasson David,Livian,01/05/1993,anglais,Training for strategic change: some conditions of effectiveness,"In this paper, a case in the banking sector in France is presented because this is particularly illustrative of some advanced training policies. Hence it enables several general conclusions to be drawn about their strategic effectiveness. One particular conclusion is that a training programme aimed at raising educational levels or basic skills which is not rapidly and completely articulated to professional programmes and actions about career paths is doomed to raise frustrations and miss, at least partially, its objectives. To consider training as a strategic HRM tool is thus not enough: indeed, there is a complex reality of training in practice."

Crespin-Mazet Florence,Spencer,01/09/1990,anglais,Accounting for geographical characteristics in networks,"Recent research in the field of industrial marketing has turned towards approaches capable of handling the complexity of the firm's environment, and especially its international environment. In this context, the network concept has attracted growing interest in management literature as it offers potential for the development of integrative analytical means and management tools. The criteria for applying network approaches call, however, for further exploration and development. Based on the study of the networks faced with and established by a French supplier firm in three European countries : France, Sweden and West Germany, this paper demonstrates how geographical characteristics can constitute criteria for network segmentation and hence, strategy formulation. For each of the three countries studied, we illustrate the different geographical"" characteristics of the networks, and the consequences for strategic behaviour (modes of penetration, development and maintenance in the network). These geographical network characteristics can in part be explained by the size of the customer country studied, the structure of the customer industry in this country, the existence of zones defined by their specific economic, cultural, political or administrative systems (example : the existence of lander in West-Germany). They can be expressed in terms of ""levels"" of geographical network (global, national, local etc.), of numbers of actors at each level, of inter-level links etc... Optimisation of investment by the firm in networks would require that these geographical characteristics be explicitly taken into account when elaborating strategy. This paper intends to open-up the debate in this respect, and seek suggestions as to how this may be handled"""
